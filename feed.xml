            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Resources for people planning the Great Himalaya Trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_1600,dpr_auto/v1550183229/overview-map-5000.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Himalaya Trail is the combination of several trail networks stretching the length of the
Himalaya range, with sections in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. From April to September 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/about/&#34;&gt;Mathi&lt;/a&gt; and I
hiked the Nepal section from Kanchenjunga (on the Indian border in the East) to Hilsa (on the Chinese border
in the West).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the high route is that it follows the highest feasible continuous route across the
country, averaging 3,750m (12,000ft) of elevation, with passes reaching 6,200m (20,300ft).
In total 1,400km (870 miles) over 115 days of hiking, with 120,000m (400,000ft) of elevation gain -
that&#39;s an average climb of 1,000m (3,300ft) per day. Including rest days, we completed the trek in 154 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the route passes through the more popular trekking areas of Everest and Annapurna, many
sections visit some of the most remote corners of Nepal. We completed trek with the minimum of support,
so no guides or porters us unless absolutely necessary for safety or mandated by local law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the GHT, I made comprehensive trail notes and a FAQ for people planning the trail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great place to ask questions is my &lt;a href=&#34;https://chat.whatsapp.com/D5kC4kBc7SALDE8WctMmrH&#34;&gt;GHT WhatsApp group&lt;/a&gt;.
In the group are several people who have completed the trek, and several who are planning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vlog&#34;&gt;Vlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filmed a short vlog style video every day of the trek. You can find weekly summaries here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-01&#34;&gt;Week 1: Kanchenjunga&lt;/a&gt; - I&#39;m hiking up the Kanchenjunga Base Camp trail towards the far north east corner of Nepal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-02&#34;&gt;Week 2: Kanchenjunga&lt;/a&gt; - I reached the amazing Kanchenjunga Base Camp, and started the first really remote section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-03&#34;&gt;Week 3: Makalu&lt;/a&gt; - The trail is getting really tough as I cross the first high pass.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-05&#34;&gt;Week 5: Everest&lt;/a&gt; - We cross the highest, most technical and most dangerous passes of the whole trek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-06&#34;&gt;Week 6: Everest&lt;/a&gt; - We hike through the most spectacular scenery as we take a detour to Cho Oyu Base Camp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-07&#34;&gt;Week 7: Rolwaling&lt;/a&gt; - More amazing scenery as we tackle yet another major pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-08&#34;&gt;Week 8: Rolwaling&lt;/a&gt; - We leave the high mountains and get our first taste of how hot and humid Nepal can be at the lower elevations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-09&#34;&gt;Week 9: Helambu&lt;/a&gt; - A week of slogging through heat, humidity and leeches into the high mountains again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-10&#34;&gt;Week 10: Langtang&lt;/a&gt; - Another huge pass with full mountaineering gear, and we take a very refreshing swim on the way down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-11&#34;&gt;Week 11: Ganesh Himal&lt;/a&gt; - Finally monsoon hits, we both get sick and make some huge navigational blunders. A hard week!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-14&#34;&gt;Week 14: Mustang&lt;/a&gt; - We take an unconventional exit from Annapurna, and enter the utterly spectacular Dolpa region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-15&#34;&gt;Week 15: Dolpa&lt;/a&gt; - The scenery gets better and better as we trek through Dolpa, but will we make it out of the mountains in one piece? Major navigation and tent disasters this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-16&#34;&gt;Week 16: Dolpa&lt;/a&gt; - Long, hot, exhausting days across rugged terrain as we continue through Dolpa&amp;hellip; and we&#39;re lucky to be alive after some terrible decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-17&#34;&gt;Week 17: Rara&lt;/a&gt; - Baking in the sun, sinking in the mud, and we cross the final 5,000m pass of the trek.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Frequently Asked Questions</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Questions I&#39;ve been asked many times by people preparing for the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;safety&#34;&gt;Safety&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a quick note about safety. The Great Himalaya Trail is a dangerous undertaking, with sections where one trip or wrong footstep can be fatal. Towards the end of our thru-hike we got in touch with a girl named Milena Piasecka from Poland. We gave her advice on various subjects as she planned here GHT, and she started just as we were finishing. A couple of months later, in the Everest region, she was tragically killed in a fall. There were sections where this could have happened virtually every day. All it takes is a loss of concentration or a wrong turn. Be very aware of this when contemplating the Great Himalaya Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;whats-the-recommended-itinerary&#34;&gt;What&#39;s the recommended itinerary?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/&#34;&gt;trail notes&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get this data in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14x_OJ4mJNoHuj1LnYnyGULdE3P9kG6CwOdY1t0sv_H8/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;spreadsheet form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-the-most-difficult--technical-parts&#34;&gt;What are the most difficult / technical parts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s five &amp;ldquo;technical&amp;rdquo; mountaineering passes, where you will need mountaineering gear and experience: Sherpani Col (leg 28), West Col (leg 29), Amphu Labsta (leg 31), Tashi Labsta (leg 43) and Tilman&#39;s Pass (leg 61). See the descriptions in my trail notes for more details. Unless you have an experienced mountaineer in your group, you&#39;ll need to take a guide for these sections. We tried to minimize the amount of time we were with the guide, so we only trekked with him the minimum to conveniently cross the five passes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legs 25-31 (Makalu Base Camp to Chhukung) Sherpani Col, West Col and Amphu Labsta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legs 40-44 (Thame to Na) Tashi Labsta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legs 54-62 (Last Resort to Kyangjin Gompa) Tilman&#39;s Pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a guide that will take you over Tilman&#39;s Pass is rather more difficult than the other passes. The guide we took for the first four passes didn&#39;t want to take us over Tilman&#39;s Pass, and the guide we eventually found had never done it before and afterwards he said he would never do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-you-need-mountaineering-gear-for-the-other-parts&#34;&gt;Do you need mountaineering gear for the other parts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started in the east in mid-April, and hugely regret not taking my crampons and ice axe. The first few high sections (Nango La, Lumbha Sumbha, Molun Pokhari) were all extremely dangerous without crampons. I would probably recommend always having crampons at the ready, but we sent ours home at the Syabru Besi resupply point (mid-July) and didn&#39;t need them for the rest of the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-did-you-organise-resupply--guides--logistics--permits&#34;&gt;How did you organise resupply / guides / logistics / permits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a trekking company called &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:mactrek@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Mactrek&lt;/a&gt; who specialise in this sort of logistical assistance. Our point of contact, Narayan, totally understood that we wanted to use the minimum amount of on-trail assistance, and helped us with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advice for the pre-trek planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A porter for the resupply points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mountaineering guide for the technical passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the permits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advice and emergency assistance (e.g. booking my helicopter rescue).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-permits&#34;&gt;What about permits?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your exact route you&#39;ll need a bunch of permits. Some of these can only be arranged in Kathmandu and have specific dates, so these had to be arranged while we were on the trek and delivered by the resupply porter. Narayan at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:mactrek@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Mactrek&lt;/a&gt; will be able to take a look at your itinerary and let you know which permits are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;do-we-really-need-the-500-usd-upper-dolpa-permit&#34;&gt;Do we really need the $500 USD Upper Dolpa permit?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow my itinerary, you do. I would highly recommend it too, because that had some of the most spectacular scenery of the entire trek. We were never actually stopped at any checkpoints when leaving Kagbeni (I think we just got lucky), but I would always recommend having the correct permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;some-of-the-sections-a-guide-is-mandatory&#34;&gt;Some of the sections a guide is mandatory?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is true. We tried to hike the entire route without a guide. This caused problems only in Manaslu where we were stopped for 24 hours and they insisted we take a local guide for three days. If you prefer not to hike with a guide, my recommendation is just to go for it. Any checkpoint that will stop you for not having a guide is highly likely to be able to arrange a local guide to take you. If you&#39;re stopped, just make it clear that you&#39;re not going to turn around, and you&#39;ll stay there until they arrange a local guide. Make sure you have flexibility in your budget to pay for the guide if this happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-the-best-resupply-points&#34;&gt;What are the best resupply points?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used eight resupply points: Ghunsa, Makalu Base Camp, Thame, Last Resort, Syabru Besi, Muktinath, Ringmo and Gamgadhi. In hindsight we could have probably reduced this by relying more on resupplying with food along the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-can-you-resupply-with-camping-food-along-the-route&#34;&gt;When can you resupply with camping food along the route?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only food we found for sale along the trek that could be prepared with a backpacking stove were instant noodles. The most common brand is WaiWai (pronounced &amp;ldquo;why-why&amp;rdquo;). These can be either eaten dry or rehydrated with hot water. They are available throughout the trek anywhere you find a shop, and most of the guesthouses will sell them. However many of the small remote villages don&#39;t have shops or guesthouses. As a rule of thumb, most of the days on the trail notes where guesthouse accommodation is available should be able to also sell you instant noodles. If only homestay accommodation is available, it&#39;s less likely. Prices range from 30 rupees ($0.25 USD) in places with good road links to as much as 200 rupees ($1.70 USD) in the Everest region. Remember these are only 300 calories per pack so you&#39;ll need ~10 packs per day if you&#39;re eating nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;whats-the-temperature-like&#34;&gt;What&#39;s the temperature like?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a rough estimate of the overnight temperature of each leg, by taking the average climatic temperature in Kathmandu for that month and applying the adiabatic lapse rate (e.g. 10C colder per 1000m) for the elevation of that leg. This worked reasonably well. I never actually saw my thermometer drop below -10C but it&#39;s likely it was colder in the middle of the night at high elevation camp sites. You can find the estimates on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/temperatures/&#34;&gt;Temperatures page&lt;/a&gt;, or in the &amp;ldquo;Overnight temperatures&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Daytime temperatures&amp;rdquo; tabs of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11E4EsvVkA5kDInVFhQgkSxWPcoLTu8LEifQxC1WAN8c/edit&#34;&gt;planning sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Although it shows the minimum temperature dropping to -30C, that&#39;s the campsite between Sherpani Col and West Col at 6000m, which most people will skip. Obviously these are very rough estimates, and the actual temperature will depend on the local weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-is-it-best-to-start&#34;&gt;When is it best to start?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started in mid April. This means we have to trek through monsoon. This isn&#39;t ideal, but the alternative is to start in the autumn and trek through winter. Trekking through winter has a couple of issues. The locals that live in the small villages in the high mountains usually all disappear to the lower regions during winter, so it&#39;s not uncommon to find villages that are completely deserted. Additionally the high passes are often snowbound with avalanche danger in the winter. Although trekking through monsoon sounds bad, we only get really wet every day for about a week. I&#39;d highly recommend a good umbrella, because your gore-tex layers won&#39;t work - at the lower elevations it&#39;s so hot and humid, that within 10 minutes of hiking in waterproofs you&#39;ll be completely drenched with sweat. We bought umbrellas in a shop on the trek and they worked wonderfully to keep us dry. As soon as there was enough wind to make the umbrellas useless then it was usually the right conditions to put waterproofs on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-navigational-sources-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What navigational sources would you recommend?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend using several essential navigation sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trail notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My trail notes can be printed with or without the summary maps. I&#39;d recommend printing them &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes-no-maps/&#34;&gt;without maps&lt;/a&gt;, because the maps included with the trail notes aren&#39;t great. Printing them without maps and double sided will run to 43 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My GPS routes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After the trek I updated and improved my GPX route files, and I would recommend using the latest version as your primary navigation route. You can download the GPX files on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gps-routes/&#34;&gt;GPS routes page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps.me and Gaia GPS apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gps-routes/&#34;&gt;GPS routes page&lt;/a&gt; for more information about my navigation app recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robin Boustead created the definitive set of ten maps for the GHT and they are still very useful today. They are available as paper or high-res digital files &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.greathimalayatrail.com/shop/&#34;&gt;at Robin&#39;s shop&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the digital files aren&#39;t geo-coded so can&#39;t be imported into mapping apps - this is a real shame because they are excellent. Also note that the paper maps ship from Nepal, and can take several weeks to arrive. We had the paper maps for each section brought with our resupply packages, since carrying 10 printed maps for the entire trek would be rather heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;communications&#34;&gt;Communications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Garmin InReach satellite communicator device is absolutely essential. This works with the Iridium satellite network, so works anywhere in the world without needing mobile coverage. It has three essential functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows you to send and receive short text messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracks your location on a map, so your logistical helpers can keep track of you and alert the emergency services if you disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SOS button that alerts the emergency services if you get in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the InReach Mini which I would highly recommend. It&#39;s the smallest and lightest of the InReach devices - it does exactly what I need and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;power&#34;&gt;Power&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re relying on your phone for navigating and your InReach for emergency communications, you better be 100% sure you&#39;re not going to run out of power. Plenty of the villages you&#39;ll pass have no power, so there are stretches of many days where you will have to be energy independent. We had big problems with solar panels being too small, malfunctioning, cables breaking etc. If I was to do this trek again, I would make sure I had a foldable 28W solar panel (Anker, BigBlue etc) for each member of the group, and a 15 or 20,000 mAh power bank each. Definitely don&#39;t rely on having a single solar panel or power bank. This is not an area I would skimp on weight again. Our power needs were keeping two iPhones and one InReach Mini charged, so a group with additional gear might need more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-do-you-get-back-to-kathmandu-from-hilsa&#34;&gt;How do you get back to Kathmandu from Hilsa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived (September 2019) there was a regular helicopter service ferrying locals between Simikot and Hilsa for the regular Mount Kailash pilgrimage. I&#39;ve been told this doesn&#39;t run all the time though. We got lucky and there were two spaces available on the last helicopter of the day, and negotiated a price of about $100 per person. The alternative is a jeep / lorry that will take you most of the way back to Simikot, but the road was incomplete, so the jeep would have dropped us at Kermi. Kermi to Simikot is about a 6 hour hike, so realistically would have taken two days to get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-mobile-coverage&#34;&gt;What about mobile coverage?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the trail has no mobile coverage at all, but for the places that do, I would highly recommend getting both Nepal Telecom (aka NTC or Namaste) and NCell sim cards. Nepal Telecom has coverage in many more places, but it&#39;s almost always very slow. NCell has spotty coverage but usually much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-much-did-everything-cost&#34;&gt;How much did everything cost?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very approximate cost, for two people in USD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Logistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resupply packages brought from Kathmandu to 8 points along the trail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mountaineering guide&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To assist us over the five technical passes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Permits&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1,600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Including $500  per person for a week in the Upper Dolpa region&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Food&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Backpacking food brought with us from the UK&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Spending money&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;To cover guest houses and food along the trek&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Helicopter rescue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$3,500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Oops&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely could have saved money by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing the number of resupply packages (although the porter was only charging $20/day, some of the resupply packages required a 14 day round trip from and back to Kathmandu, so ended up being very expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bringing less backpacking food (we brought food for about 60 nights camping, but only camped for about 30 nights).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having a helicopter rescue (duh).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budgeting more on food / accommodation during the trek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-tent-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What tent would you recommend?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a Hyperlight Mountain Gear Ultamid 4, which is a four season DCF (Dyneema Composite Fabric) pyramid tent that you erect with a single central pole (we used two hiking poles joined together with special rubber clips). Apart from a problem with the zip, it performed really well. The tent is just a pyramid of material with no inner, so we also used the full-size inner tent insert which gives you bug net and a waterproof bathtub floor. The only real downside was the space needed to set up. However, once it&#39;s set up, it&#39;s a palace for two people inside. One thing to remember is that in 80% of the campsites you won&#39;t be able to get pegs in the ground. Attaching a longer piece of cord to all the pegging points is essential, so you can wrap it around rocks. I recommend at least one meter of extra cord wherever you have a pegging point. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00Q9IHL0O&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-about-travel-insurance&#34;&gt;What about travel insurance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The travel insurance business is highly regional, so I can only speak for companies that cover UK residents. I searched for days for a policy that would cover mountaineering above 6000m, and the only one that I found was from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thebmc.co.uk/modules/insurance/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;the BMC&lt;/a&gt; (their &amp;ldquo;alpine and ski&amp;rdquo; cover level). Not cheap, but nothing we did on the trek was excluded by their policy wording or small print. If I remember correctly, the only other option was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dogtag.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Dogtag&lt;/a&gt; but they were even more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;more-reading&#34;&gt;More reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a Reddit AMA - it&#39;s worth a read because I answered a bunch more questions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/evqpvr/i_hiked_the_great_himalaya_trail_for_154_days/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/evr80y/i_hiked_the_great_himalaya_trail_for_154_days/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gps-routes/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Links to my GPS routes for the Great Himalaya Trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPS routes for the entire route are available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jppm4whlyn7ounz7d2s38/routes-v10.gpx?rlkey=p6id4yk00ru1srs3nwj815zs2&amp;amp;dl=0&#34;&gt;GPX ROUTES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (recommended for most apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend using the GPX file above if you can, but some apps need KML format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t00rtoyqu8uyhxwtmd4jb/routes-v10.kml?rlkey=dvghw78ftbs87dkzbpiux1s2o&amp;amp;dl=0&#34;&gt;KML&lt;/a&gt; (if gpx files don&#39;t work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/r3b3sude67bekjwx8hdgh/routes-for-maps-me-v10.kml?rlkey=62efwpx1njplnidngys9tzcvu&amp;amp;dl=0&#34;&gt;KML&lt;/a&gt; (for the maps.me app - route descriptions aren&#39;t visible in maps.me, so I&#39;ve included a waypoint with the description at the start of each leg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The routes and waypoints in the GPS files have the text from my trail notes embedded in them, which is useful for quick reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend using both the &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.me/&#34;&gt;maps.me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gaiagps.com/&#34;&gt;Gaia GPS&lt;/a&gt; apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mapsme&#34;&gt;Maps.me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#39;t have detailed topo maps but for 90% of the route it&#39;s all you need. Import my special KML file to get the route and waypoints. The offline maps are very quick to download, and you can download all the maps for the whole of Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaia-gps&#34;&gt;Gaia GPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 10% of the route where maps.me isn&#39;t useful, you&#39;ll need a topographic map. I would highly recommend Gaia GPS&amp;hellip; I didn&#39;t actually discover Gaia until after our trek finished, but it is far easier to use than the alternatives. Import my standard GPX file to get the route and waypoints. There&#39;s two sets of offline maps I&#39;d recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaia Topo offline maps is essential, and very quick to download for the entire route. Choose the highest zoom level in the download page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World Imagery offline satellite images. If you have time and space on your phone, I would highly recommend downloading satellite images for the entire route. I only downloaded these for about a quarter of the route, and it was very helpful when recently built roads were missing from the topo maps. It will take many hours to download the images for the entire route because each leg will have to be downloaded separately because of Gaia&#39;s limit on the number of tiles per download, but I&#39;d highly recommend investing the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trail was tricky to follow with a couple of large new landslides which meant lengthy diversions to find safe places to cross, and scrambling. Update from Kate (summer 2022): &amp;ldquo;The recent landslides Dave went through are fine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L009 Landslide (5,060 m / 16,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This huge landslide had recently blocked the path (as of spring 2019). A lengthy detour was needed to find a safe place to cross. The route has been updated to show my detour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L009 Pangpema (5,140 m / 16,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: There was a small shack at Pangpema (aka Kanchenjunga Base Camp) which I could have stayed at, but I chose to camp. I believe the staff come from Lhonak as and when they are needed, so best to ask them if you plan to stay overnight here without camping.&lt;/p&gt;

You should stay here overnight because after the shelter the trail deviates significantly from the description in the guidebook and paper maps. The guidebook and paper maps have you camping at the Yangma Khola bridge but I found no trail on the ground going this way, and I didn&#39;t see any more good camping options until Olangchun Gola. The shelter is almost brand new and very clean (as of spring 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tricky trail to follow, especially the first half before the new bridge. I suspect this trial will be changing regularly, because it was relatively new (spring 2019). Update from Kate (summer 2022): &amp;ldquo;Deviation - the new trail Dave took is no longer visible. We took the old trail further north. Very overgrown and difficult to follow. The &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; bridge is still there, but we could not find any trail on the east side of the river. Bridge on the route I took is further upstream than the river crossing shown on GPS.&amp;rdquo; I&#39;ve added a new waypoint &amp;ldquo;North Bridge&amp;rdquo; showing where Kate found the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L015 Deviation (3,610 m / 11,800 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: After the shelter, the trail deviates significantly from the guidebook and paper maps. The digital maps still show the old trail (as of spring 2019). I have updated the route to follow the new trail, which takes a more southerly path to a new bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail was tricky to follow, and obscured by snow at higher elevations. The upper part of the valley that leads to the lake, and the traverse around the lake are extremely dangerous when covered in snow. I didn&#39;t have crampons which made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin&#39;s guidebook explains how to find a bridge over the Kholakharka Khola, but despite hours of searching I didn&#39;t manage to find it. I eventually stayed overnight in the shelter at the source of the river, where it&#39;s easy to cross. The next day I tried to follow the river downstream on the east bank, but found no trail and dense undergrowth. I gave up and called a helicopter. Craig (2019) got further by scrambling over rocks in the river gully, only to find the pass impossible the next day - he too ended up calling a helicopter. Suvi (2019) managed to find a way across the river, and I&#39;ve added a waypoint with her approximate crossing point&amp;hellip; However I&#39;d only recommend crossing the river if there&#39;s a bridge. I have update this route from Mike (2025) with his accurate track. He didn&#39;t find a way across the river, and crossed at the source like I did. He managed to find a way down on the other side. It seems most people are doing this route, so I&#39;d recommend following this option unless you can find an obvious way across the river lower down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Cliffs (4,110 m / 13,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure you traverse below these cliffs, not above. I made the mistake of traversing steep snow directly above the cliffs where a slip could have meant a nasty fall. There is no need to traverse above the cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Dhungge Khola (3,620 m / 11,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The bridge over the Dhungge Khola was just two planks of wood (spring 2019). The guidebook mentions it is often washed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Kholakharka Khola (3,010 m / 9,870 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The guidebook explains how to find a bridge over the Kholakharka Khola that is located somewhere around this waypoint. However despite hours of searching, I could not find the bridge. However Suvi (2019) found the bridge and I&#39;ve estimated it&#39;s position with a waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Shelter (3,190 m / 10,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a large flat kharka at the source of the Kholakharka Khola, and a reasonably clean shelter where I stayed overnight. The river is easily crossed at this location, and there was a log bridge (spring 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Suvi Crossed (3,020 m / 9,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Suvi (2019) managed to cross the river here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this unless there is a bridge or it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Clearing Camp (3,000 m / 9,830 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Suvi (2019): &amp;ldquo;There was a little grassy clearing and some locals had stayed there earlier because there was a fire place and some wooden structures. It was quite dirty with Yak poop though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Mike added that there are several sets of steep stone steps going down from passes after Kalo Pokhari and in April/May they may be very snowy/icy. Micro spikes required at a minimum. Suvi (2019) reported that the trail is extremely tricky to follow with sections of bushwhacking.

&lt;p&gt;The route is on crevassed, glaciated terrain all day. The safest route across the glacier and over Sherpani Col may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L028 Sherpani Col (6,160 m / 20,200 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Crossing Sherpani Col involves a 100m climb, then a 100m down climb on the other side. We were able to clip into a fixed safety wire for the climb and descent, but a fall would still be extremely dangerous. At the bottom of the down-climb there was a small bergschrund before we reached the crevassed glacial plateau that separates Sherpani Col and West Col.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L028 Advanced Base Camp (6,110 m / 20,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Although the itinerary proposes an overnight stay here at Advanced Base Camp I would highly recommend not camping here. Most groups continue over West Col and complete legs 28 and 29 in one long day, as we did. The plateau is at 6000m and extremely exposed, so camping here should only be attempted in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure you bring a 200m rope for the rappel and do not rely on ropes left behind by previous teams, which are often unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t hike most of this leg, having followed a different path, so the ratings for route and trail are just for the last part of this leg. The part of the trail we did hike was tricky to follow and frequently involved scrambling over glacial moraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphu Labsta is one of the most dangerous passes in Nepal, and the route climbs technical terrain to reach the pass. The safest route may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L031 Amphu Labsta (5,830 m / 19,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The access to Amphu Labsta is via a huge ice fall, with platforms of snow and ice to navigate. Our route differs significantly from that marked on digital maps, but I&#39;m sure the safest route is different every year. Parts of the ascent we were able to clip into a safety wire, but there were parts where it was hidden under impenetrable ice. After the pass a 30m rappel is needed. The hike down into the basin below is extremely dangerous, with very loose rocks on a high gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L037 Cho La (5,370 m / 17,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The approach to Cho La involved some scrambling and a short hike across a relatively flat section of glacier. It was free of crevasses and crampons were not needed when we crossed, however if conditions were bad this section could be problematic. The descent on the other side was steep, but a safety cable was fixed on the dangerous sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail crosses an enormous glacier, which is constantly eroding and changing. The path is marked by cairns but these seem to be placed all over the place and don&#39;t really mark out a single trail. We took many wrong turns and had to backtrack several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail started off easy to follow, but because progressively harder as the day went on. The final part to the campsite was a scramble up a steep rocky slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L042 Shelter (4,870 m / 16,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a nice, clean shelter. It seems to be relatively new as of spring 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L042 Tashi Labsta Camp (5,220 m / 17,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at this very exposed, windy, rocky camp site. This was one of the worst camp sites of the trek. If conditions aren&#39;t perfect, I would recommend considering staying overnight at the shelter. If you do this, be sure to leave early the next day because it adds 1.2km and a 330m climb to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leg-43-tashi-labsta-camp-to-glacier-camp&#34;&gt;Leg 43: Tashi Labsta Camp to Glacier Camp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route is on crevassed, glaciated terrain for most of the day. Although not as technical as Amphu Labsta, the same warnings apply. The safest route across Tashi Labsta may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L043 Tashi Labsta (5,770 m / 18,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The approach to Tashi Labsta is up a huge steep pile of glacial moraine with constant danger of rocks slipping. We then climbed a very steep snow bank, which required ropes and crampons. The final section across the glacier and up to the pass was under cliffs with constant danger of rock fall from above. The first half of the descent down from the pass was extremely difficult, following the glacier with many crevasses to cross. The final part of the descent was even worse where we had to climb down a stream gully with water splashing all over us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L043 Glacier Camp (4,880 m / 16,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at this very rocky area on the glacier. I suspect that a better site could be found given more time but the sun was going down so we took the first opportunity to pitch the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg follows the glacier, a huge boulder field. An altogether unpleasant experience. There is a trail along the top of the lateral moraine on the left side, and I believe it starts earlier than we picked it up, so I would recommend trying to climb the moraine before our route does. The second half of the day was an easy to follow trail down the Na.&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s the base station for a major hydroelectric project, so full of lorries, and much lower so very hot and humid. I would recommend staying at Simigaon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L052 Road (2,240 m / 7,340 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: As you leave Bigu Gompa, be sure to descend all the way down to the road marked by this waypoint. We took a footpath higher up the valley, which led up the river valley to the north. We continued for an hour before realising it was not possible to continue that way, and had to backtrack all the way to the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this leg was a very dangerous traverse across a steep hillside above cliffs with very little in the way of a path - a slip here could have been deadly. We then had to negotiate a section of dense rhododendron bushes with many dead-ends and backtracking. Hundreds of leeches were a major annoyance. After that we found a dirt road, but a major navigational blunder meant we missed the correct trail Sano Jyandan. We didn&#39;t stay at Sano Jyandan, so the rating is for the guesthouse we stayed at in Madre. However, I have left the route going via Sano Jyandan and I would recommend you try to follow it. If anyone has successfully completed this section, please get in touch (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I&#39;d love to integrate your GPS tracks into this route. Note that in the vlog I incorrectly state that we passed Sano Jyandan, in fact our track turns off well before this. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;If you are on steep cliffs you are not high enough. We left the road from Tinsang Kewa at the high point where there are prayer flags. Followed a light animal trail that became a nice trail that continued farther up. It was to the right of your GPX track. No dangerous parts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L053 Warning (3,040 m / 9,980 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We made a huge navigational blunder here. The dirt road follows a switchback to the left, and we assumed it followed the route towards Sano Jyandan. We were wrong and it continued in completely the wrong direction down into the basin to the south. The correct route traverses along the ridge to Sano Jyandan before descending towards the north. As we descended we slowly realised that the road would not be rejoining the correct route, but by the time we fully understood this we had lost significant elevation, and the climb back up to the ridge seemed too far. We continued descending, hoping that the road would eventually lead us west and follow the hillside around towards the north. We realise the road we were on didn&#39;t go that way, but a road below us did head that way, so we bushwhacked down to the lower road. This ended up being a major detour and we ended up staying at a homestay at Madre. I have left the route going to Sano Jyandan, but it should be noted that we didn&#39;t hike it past this waypoint. The route in the GPX file after this point is just copied from the paper maps, so should not be relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L053 Madre (2,080 m / 6,830 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed at a basic guesthouse in Madre, which was the result of a major navigational blunder. I would recommend trying to stick to the route and find Sano Jyandan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our navigational blunder from the previous day meant we skipped most of this leg, however I suspect the section we missed is tricky, since there is no trail shown on digital maps. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;We did make it through to Sano Jyandan and on. There are many trails to follow so it took a lot of trial and error. The &amp;ldquo;L054 Trail&amp;rdquo; waypoint marks the beginning of the trail that is the correct route. It is a trail for a while then comes to a road. Both the road and trail go to the same place. The trail is shorter, but very slippery when muddy. There are trails that go in the direction of the GPX route, but they all turned to dead ends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail follows the glacier up to Tillmans Pass, and involves scrambling over glacial boulder fields for most of the day. I believe we made a mistake by following the lateral moraine on the west side of the glacier. A better option would be to get on the east side. This would mean less scrambling since you don&#39;t have to cross a second glacier that joins from the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route crosses crevassed, glaciated terrain. Although not as technical as Tashi Labsta or Amphu Labsta, care is needed. The safest route across Tilman&#39;s Pass may change year-to-year so some mountaineering experience is recommended. Full mountaineering gear is recommended for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L061 Tilman&#39;s Pass (5,300 m / 17,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The approach to Tilman&#39;s Pass is up a steep icy glacial slope. When we crossed, crampons and ice axe were sufficient for safety but if conditions were different, ropes may have been needed. The descent was less steep but again if conditions were worse it could be more tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L061 High North Camp (4,550 m / 14,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: After a long scramble down the glacial boulder field we found a reasonably nice campsite here. I believe we hiked further down the glacier than is indicated on the paper maps, but I would recommend pushing on to here because it&#39;s a nice flat grassy area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had major problems here. The route before the Langtang Khola crossing is very wild - no trail on the ground and often bushwhacking through dense shrubland. Moving through this terrain is slow and frustrating. We descended the Langshisha Khola from High North Camp on the west moraine towards Langshisha Kharka. This was a bad decision because the only bridge over the Langtang Khola was on the east side of the Langshisha Khola. We spent most of the day bushwhacking back up the Langshisha Khola through dense shrubland to find a safe place to cross, only to give up and return to Langshisha Kharka to camp overnight. We continued searching early the next morning, hoping the water would be lower. It was noticeably lower but still too dangerous to cross. Our party split up, and the two others managed to cross the Langshisha Khola nearer the glacier. Mathi and I eventually made a very dangerous crossing of the Langtang Khola assisted by a rope. We were swept away by the fast flowing river and dragged to safety by the others on the opposite side. This was a really bad idea and not recommended in the slightest. I have updated the route to immediately descend from High North Camp and cross the Langshisha Khola as soon as possible. Be very careful descending from High North Camp towards the Langshisha Khola - in October 2021 Eyal experienced very difficult terrain and dangerous avalanche conditions here and had a bad fall. Take your time and be prepared to backtrack to find a safer route. Once you&#39;re across the Langshisha Khola, the route continues down on the east side to the bridge. Be aware that this was the situation in spring 2019, and the bridge may have been changed (update in October 2021: the bridge is still there). Also with less water in the river this could have been a completely different experience. After you cross the Langtang Khola to the north bank you pick up the Langtang trail which is well maintained and easy to follow. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where your GPX marks that you go down to the river has been taken out by landslides. At this part we went back up to the left parallel to the river until it flattened out a bit. We crossed one landslide gully and then followed the second one down to the river. We had no visibility so one might be able to see a better route. We had no problems on the climb down, but I imagine it is constantly changing. We were able to cross the river just upstream from where we reached the river and had no problems on the east side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L062 Cross (4,410 m / 14,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Although we didn&#39;t hike this way, my advice is to cross the Langshisha Khola approximately here, as high as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L062 Langshisha Khola (4,240 m / 13,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Langshisha Khola is the drainage river of the Langshisha Glacier that yesterday&#39;s route follows. My advice is to cross this as soon as possible and descend on the east bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care to find where the footpath diverges from the road. We made a navigational blunder by following the road too far. The road leads to Tipling but switchbacks mean it is 29km long instead of 14km on the footpath. In the end we bushwhacked for an hour back to the footpath. Once you&#39;re on the footpath it&#39;s relatively easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a different route via Dharot, but this is not recommended. Jeff (2025) found a better route so I&#39;ve updated this leg to follow his track. Jeff: &amp;ldquo;The first part of the climb is on a nice new trail, then it turns to an older shepherd&#39;s Trail before hitting the pass. From the pass the nice new trail continues north and connects to Khorlabeshi. I&#39;d recommend people take this path as it looks nicer. Probably no water until the bottom though. My track continues down the pass off trail for a few hundred meters (waypoint &amp;ldquo;L069 Jeff&amp;rdquo;) until it connects with a new road down to the hydro works. From there you can follow it to Kashigaun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

This is an excellent option if you want a more remote route. It involves two nights of camping and some tricky to follow trails. I will include trail notes for this option at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very tricky to follow trail, which was steep with slippery crumbling slate fragments underfoot in places. We made a navigational blunder by following what looked like a horse track on the ground. This led in the wrong direction and we then chose a dangerous exposed traverse instead of backtracking (the route does not take this detour). Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The shelter at Sangda Phedi has collapsed as of 2021. The river was easily crossable without needing to get wet feet. We had no navigational issues in this section as the trail was well traveled and some of it was road.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Sangda Phedi (5,150 m / 16,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at a nice shelter in Sangda Phedi just before the ascent to Jungben La. If you stay overnight here, take note of the options for crossing the river in the morning. When we crossed there was a partially broken bridge, and although the river was shallow, we had to get wet feet. An early morning start at over 5,000m meant that it was well below freezing, and getting wet was very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Jungben La (5,550 m / 18,200 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: From the river a very easy 400m ascent up a gravel slope leads to Jungben La.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Niwas La (5,140 m / 16,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: When approaching from the east, Niwas La has no real ascent, and the only real indication you&#39;ve reached it is a pile of rocks with prayer flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Nulungsumda Kharka (4,970 m / 16,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We didn&#39;t actually stay overnight here, but after the descent from Niwas La the terrain flattens out and there is a flat grassy area here. We saw some herders in tents here so you may also be able to get food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a huge problem here. The trail on the east side of the Thansan Khola was blocked. We backtracked and camped overnight at Norbulung. In the morning we made a very bad decision. I believe the best way would have been to continue towards Chharka Bhot on the west bank after crossing the Thansan Khola. I would recommend doing this, and have left the route going this way to Chharka Bhot even though we didn&#39;t go this way. We made the decision to hike up the Yalku Khola, heading towards one of the passes near Chharka Bhot. The upper parts of the Yalku Khola were not passable, and the pass we were aiming for didn&#39;t look safe at all. We changed plans several times, and ended up hiking for two days over mountainous terrain with no trails on the map or the ground. The route we took skipped Chharka Bhot entirely and continued directly west across the mountains to the Chap Chu East waypoint, camping overnight at Sipalun Kharka. This part of the route was relatively easy with no particularly dangerous terrain. However, the problem is that you arrive at Chap Chu on the east side of the Bharbun Khola. There is no bridge and when we were there (August 16th) the river was far too swollen to cross. After taking advice from some Yak herders, we followed a rough trail south to Sinjik expecting the water to be lower, however this was incorrect and in fact the water was higher. Sinjik was deserted with a few derelict buildings, and as far as we could see the path finished there and we couldn&#39;t go any further south. We were out of options and about to give up when a local man appeared and led us along the most perilous trails I&#39;ve ever hiked in my life. Slippery rocks with certain death falls inches away. I would highly recommend not trying to repeat this route! After a couple of hours we arrived in Thinmer where we stayed overnight in a basic homestay. Thinmer has a bridge over the Bharbun Khola, and the trail north to Chap Chu on the west side of the river was safe and well maintained. If you would like our detailed GPS tracks for this route, you can find them in our raw GPX logs (days 123-126), however be warned that the section from Sinjik to Thinmer was exceedingly dangerous and I would absolutely not repeat it myself. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where you marked the trail as blocked there is actually a road on the west side of the river now. It crosses back to the east after maybe a kilometer. The rest of the way is an easy road.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Thansan Khola (4,680 m / 15,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Thansan Khola flows north towards Chharka Bhot, and all digital / printed maps show a trail following the east bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Cross (4,760 m / 15,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Thansan Khola is shallow at this point and we easily crossed (August 15th). My recommendation is to cross here to the west side and continue to Chharka Bhot this way. Note we didn&#39;t hike this way, so the route is only approximate and you may need to cross the river again before reaching Chharka Bhot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Blocked (4,730 m / 15,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The trail on the east side of the Thansan Khola was blocked here. With less water in the river it may be possible to pass this point by wading in the water, but when we were here (August 15th) it was completely impossible. Note that we didn&#39;t hike past this point, but I have left the route going this way as per the digital / paper maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Norbulung (4,760 m / 15,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at a nice flat grassy campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Chharka Bhot (4,300 m / 14,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We didn&#39;t stay here, but I believe Chharka Bhot is a small village where you might be able to arrange a basic homestay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Yalku Khola (4,850 m / 15,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We made a bad decision to follow the Yalku Khola upstream trying to find an alternative route to Chharka Bhot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Sipalun Kharka (5,220 m / 17,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at a relatively flat area here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Chap Chu East (4,260 m / 14,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is on the opposite side of the river to Chap Chu, and we found no safe way to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Sinjik (4,080 m / 13,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We were expecting to be able to stay overnight in a homestay in Sinjik, but the buildings were all derelict and nobody was living there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Thinmer (4,050 m / 13,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The path we followed south from Sinjik to Thinmer was extremely dangerous and I would not repeat it. Thinmer is a small village and we stayed overnight in basic homestay. There is a bridge over the Bharbun Khola at Thinmer and the trail leading north towards Chap Chu on the west side is safe and well maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Bharbun Khola (4,120 m / 13,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bharbun Khola flows south from Chharka Bhot, past Sinjik and Thinmer. It was far too dangerous to cross when we were there (August 15th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme care should be taken if hiking this route from Chharka Bhot to Chap Chu. We did not hike this way, and the route is just copied from the paper maps. There is no trail shown on digital maps, which usually indicates the trail on the ground is tenuous or non-existent. The guidebook mentions there are several crossings of the Bharbun Khola required with no bridge. We only saw that river south (downstream) of Chap Chu, but I would expect crossing it would have been impossible even further upstream when we were there (August 16th). The guidebook and paper maps mention an alternative trail that takes a more remote northerly route from Chharka Bhot to Dho Tarap via Mola La (5030m) and Jhyarkoi La (5360m). I suggest you talk to locals at Chharka Bhot and work out the best option considering the current conditions. It may be possible to arrange a local guide - I would highly recommend that. Again I must stress that I believe this leg would have been impossible when we were here (August 16th) due to the river being too swollen. If you find a reliable, safe route through this section, please contact me (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I would love to use your GPS tracks and trail notes here. Update from Kate (2012): &amp;ldquo;Most of this section is also road now. The only trail section is the last ~5k to Chap Chu. We had no dangerous river crossings and no trouble following the trail (Sept 2, 2021). Charka Bhot had a couple guesthouses, but we only stopped for lunch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg was extremely tricky, and required long sections of bushwhacking through dense shrubland. There were several crossings of a river, which was small enough that we managed to avoid getting our feet wet by hopping across rocks. As soon as we climbed above the treeline the terrain become easier to traverse and a trail on the ground became apparent. The ascent to the pass and the descent into Dho Tarap were much easier to navigate. There are several small rivers crossings with no bridges, but none were more than ankle deep (August 19th). Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Part of this is also road. We had no navigational issues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L089 Chan La (5,380 m / 17,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The ascent to Chan La was relatively easy. The slope leading to the pass was steep gravel but the trail was well worn and provided good footing. Again on the descent the trail proved easy to follow and stable underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L089 Dho Tarap (4,080 m / 13,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Dho Tarap is a paradise of rolling green pastures and fields of crops. The town is very basic but there is one nice clean guesthouse where we stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail out of Dho Tarap was a very easy hike along a well maintained trail. As we approached the pass the trail became less well defined but the terrain above the treeline was open and easy to traverse. Past the pass it got easier with a more well defined trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg was a very easy hike up a wide flat river valley along a well maintained trail. As soon as we turned right up the narrow gorge it completely changed. This section was extremely technical, scrambling up 900m of elevation over large rock obstacles. It involved dangerous leaps between rocks to cross the river numerous times. There was no trail marked on the ground, and we had to backtrack several times to find safer places to cross the river. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The narrow gorge has a very nice trail. We had no scrambling and no dangerous leaps between rocks. There were bridges for most of the river crossings. We had to ford a couple, but it was only knee deep at most (August 28, 2021). There is a new looking shelter about 500m after Pass Camp. Locals were happy to share the space with us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L093 Pass Camp (4,640 m / 15,200 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This was the first flat camping option we found since starting the ascent of the gorge. It was flat but very rocky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we made a navigational error when departing Pho. We headed approximately north towards the rightmost of two chortens that were visible in the distance from the village. After passing the chorten, the trail stopped and we spent the three hours bushwhacking across steep shrubland to the ridge. If I was to hike this leg again I&#39;d try aiming for the leftmost chorten and hope that the trail continues all the way to the ridge. When we reached the ridge, we found a trail that seemed to come from the south from the general direction of Pho, so I believe this was an easier route. However the terrain was relatively open so the section of bushwhacking didn&#39;t post any significant dangers. I have left the route following our track. If you find a better route through this section, please contact me (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I would love to use your GPS track. Once we reached the ridge, we found a trail that was relatively easy to follow. Take note of the waypoint that marks the descent from the ridge because it may be easy to miss. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The trail to the left is the correct trail. Easy to follow when you’re on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

This waypoint marks where we started climbing up the steep grassy hill towards the pass. After half an hour of bushwhacking we came across a well trodden trail coming from the south. I believe that this trail ascends from the valley starting further south from this waypoint, and you should try to find it. The gradient was very steep on this section and a fall would have been very bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a string of bad decisions today that resulted in the most dangerous situation of the trek. We missed a trail and continued hiking down the Chyandi Khola directly next to the river. As we continued the banks became increasingly steep and we had to pass increasingly dangerous obstacles to continue following the river. As the number of perilous situations we encountered grew, the prospect of backtracking through them again seemed more and more problematic. In the end, it was impossible to continue, and we made the decision to climb out of the river gorge up a steep bank. This was utterly idiotic and could have easily cost us our lives. We had no idea what was above us, and the terrain was so steep that we were basically rock climbing with no safety equipment. When we reached the top of the ridge, we found a well trodden trail that led down to a bridge over the Kaitpuchonam Khola. Neither of us were in any mood for more adventures, so we camped as soon as we crossed the bridge. I have adjusted the route to follow where I&#39;m guessing the trail comes from, but be aware that we completely missed it, so this is very approximate. We completed the rest of this leg to Takla Khola the next day, which was tricky to follow and very steep in places. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where you marked that you missed the trail that goes up the north bank is actually about where you should cross the river to the south bank. The trail goes in and out especially at the beginning, but just follow the river. There is a bridge that crosses the Chyandi Khola right by where the other bridge crosses the Kaitpuchonam Khola. We were going west to east and tried to find a trail on the north side of the river, but everything we tried cliffed out. We could see the second bridge and decided to go for it. Had no problems following the river on the south side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L099 Trail (4,280 m / 14,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We missed the trail that leads higher up the north bank of the Chyandi Khola river, so I can only guess where it starts. Be thorough searching for it, because you don&#39;t want to get into the same mess that we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dirt road has many long switchbacks, with steep footpaths that shortcut between them. This can be tricky to follow at times. When we hiked there were several extremely muddy sections, and other trekkers have confirmed this is a common problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L113 Gompa (3,180 m / 10,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We hiked up to the monastery and village at this waypoint, but could find no lodgings. Camping would be an option here but we left our tent in Simikot, so we backtracked all the way back down to the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trail was tricky to follow with a couple of large new landslides which meant lengthy diversions to find safe places to cross, and scrambling. Update from Kate (summer 2022): &amp;ldquo;The recent landslides Dave went through are fine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L009 Landslide (5,060 m / 16,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This huge landslide had recently blocked the path (as of spring 2019). A lengthy detour was needed to find a safe place to cross. The route has been updated to show my detour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L009 Pangpema (5,140 m / 16,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: There was a small shack at Pangpema (aka Kanchenjunga Base Camp) which I could have stayed at, but I chose to camp. I believe the staff come from Lhonak as and when they are needed, so best to ask them if you plan to stay overnight here without camping.&lt;/p&gt;

The guidebook and paper maps have you camping at the Yangma Khola bridge but I found no trail on the ground going this way, and I didn&#39;t see any more good camping options until Olangchun Gola.

&lt;p&gt;Tricky trail to follow, especially the first half before the new bridge. I suspect this trial will be changing regularly, because it was relatively new (spring 2019). Update from Kate (summer 2022): &amp;ldquo;Deviation - the new trail Dave took is no longer visible. We took the old trail further north. Very overgrown and difficult to follow. The &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; bridge is still there, but we could not find any trail on the east side of the river. Bridge on the route I took is further upstream than the river crossing shown on GPS.&amp;rdquo; I&#39;ve added a new waypoint &amp;ldquo;North Bridge&amp;rdquo; showing where Kate found the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

The digital maps still show the old trail (as of spring 2019). I have updated the route to follow the new trail, which takes a more southerly path to a new bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L015 Bridge (3,220 m / 10,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the new bridge over the Yangma Khola (as of spring 2019). After the bridge, the trail follows the standard route shown on digital / paper maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin&#39;s guidebook explains how to find a bridge over the Kholakharka Khola, but despite hours of searching I didn&#39;t manage to find it. I eventually stayed overnight in the shelter at the source of the river, where it&#39;s easy to cross. The next day I tried to follow the river downstream on the east bank, but found no trail and dense undergrowth. I gave up and called a helicopter. Craig (2019) got further by scrambling over rocks in the river gully, only to find the pass impossible the next day - he too ended up calling a helicopter. Suvi (2019) managed to find a way across the river, and I&#39;ve added a waypoint with her approximate crossing point&amp;hellip; However I&#39;d only recommend crossing the river if there&#39;s a bridge. I have update this route from Mike (2025) with his accurate track. He didn&#39;t find a way across the river, and crossed at the source like I did. He managed to find a way down on the other side. It seems most people are doing this route, so I&#39;d recommend following this option unless you can find an obvious way across the river lower down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Cliffs (4,110 m / 13,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure you traverse below these cliffs, not above. I made the mistake of traversing steep snow directly above the cliffs where a slip could have meant a nasty fall. There is no need to traverse above the cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Dhungge Khola (3,620 m / 11,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The bridge over the Dhungge Khola was just two planks of wood (spring 2019). The guidebook mentions it is often washed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Kholakharka Khola (3,010 m / 9,870 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The guidebook explains how to find a bridge over the Kholakharka Khola that is located somewhere around this waypoint. However despite hours of searching, I could not find the bridge. However Suvi (2019) found the bridge and I&#39;ve estimated it&#39;s position with a waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Shelter (3,190 m / 10,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a large flat kharka at the source of the Kholakharka Khola, and a reasonably clean shelter where I stayed overnight. The river is easily crossed at this location, and there was a log bridge (spring 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L022 Suvi Crossed (3,020 m / 9,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Suvi (2019) managed to cross the river here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this unless there is a bridge or it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

Mike added that there are several sets of steep stone steps going down from passes after Kalo Pokhari and in April/May they may be very snowy/icy. Micro spikes required at a minimum. Suvi (2019) reported that the trail is extremely tricky to follow with sections of bushwhacking.

&lt;p&gt;The route is on crevassed, glaciated terrain all day. The safest route across the glacier and over Sherpani Col may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L028 Sherpani Col (6,160 m / 20,200 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Crossing Sherpani Col involves a 100m climb, then a 100m down climb on the other side. We were able to clip into a fixed safety wire for the climb and descent, but a fall would still be extremely dangerous. At the bottom of the down-climb there was a small bergschrund before we reached the crevassed glacial plateau that separates Sherpani Col and West Col.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L028 Advanced Base Camp (6,110 m / 20,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Although the itinerary proposes an overnight stay here at Advanced Base Camp I would highly recommend not camping here. Most groups continue over West Col and complete legs 28 and 29 in one long day, as we did. The plateau is at 6000m and extremely exposed, so camping here should only be attempted in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L029 West Col (6,120 m / 20,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Crossing West Col involves a short 20m climb, then a 200m rappel down over vertical rocks and blue ice. Make sure you bring a 200m rope for the rappel and do not rely on ropes left behind by previous teams, which are often unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t hike most of this leg, having followed a different path, so the ratings for route and trail are just for the last part of this leg. The part of the trail we did hike was tricky to follow and frequently involved scrambling over glacial moraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L030 Rejoin (5,470 m / 17,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: One of our party fell ill, so we took an extra rest day at a lower campsite, and an alternative route from Barnutse Base Camp to Amphu Labsta Base Camp. We rejoined the trail at this waypoint. The route before this is marked as a trail on digital maps, but we didn&#39;t actually hike it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L030 Amphu Labsta Base Camp (5,510 m / 18,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We found an adequate camp site about 150m earlier than the location of the base camp marked on digital maps. It was relatively sheltered, but not particularly flat. You might do better investigating the location marked on the digital maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphu Labsta is one of the most dangerous passes in Nepal, and the route climbs technical terrain to reach the pass. The safest route may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L031 Amphu Labsta (5,830 m / 19,100 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The access to Amphu Labsta is via a huge ice fall, with platforms of snow and ice to navigate. Our route differs significantly from that marked on digital maps, but I&#39;m sure the safest route is different every year. Parts of the ascent we were able to clip into a safety wire, but there were parts where it was hidden under impenetrable ice. After the pass a 30m rappel is needed. The hike down into the basin below is extremely dangerous, with very loose rocks on a high gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If conditions aren&#39;t perfect, I would recommend considering staying overnight at the shelter. If you do this, be sure to leave early the next day because it adds 1.2km and a 330m climb to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route is on crevassed, glaciated terrain for most of the day. Although not as technical as Amphu Labsta, the same warnings apply. The safest route across Tashi Labsta may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L043 Tashi Labsta (5,770 m / 18,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The approach to Tashi Labsta is up a huge steep pile of glacial moraine with constant danger of rocks slipping. We then climbed a very steep snow bank, which required ropes and crampons. The final section across the glacier and up to the pass was under cliffs with constant danger of rock fall from above. The first half of the descent down from the pass was extremely difficult, following the glacier with many crevasses to cross. The final part of the descent was even worse where we had to climb down a stream gully with water splashing all over us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L043 Glacier Camp (4,880 m / 16,000 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at this very rocky area on the glacier. I suspect that a better site could be found given more time but the sun was going down so we took the first opportunity to pitch the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg follows the glacier, a huge boulder field. An altogether unpleasant experience. There is a trail along the top of the lateral moraine on the left side, and I believe it starts earlier than we picked it up, so I would recommend trying to climb the moraine before our route does. The second half of the day was an easy to follow trail down the Na.&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s the base station for a major hydroelectric project, so full of lorries, and much lower so very hot and humid. I would recommend staying at Simigaon.&lt;/p&gt;

We took a footpath higher up the valley, which led up the river valley to the north. We continued for an hour before realising it was not possible to continue that way, and had to backtrack all the way to the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this leg was a very dangerous traverse across a steep hillside above cliffs with very little in the way of a path - a slip here could have been deadly. We then had to negotiate a section of dense rhododendron bushes with many dead-ends and backtracking. Hundreds of leeches were a major annoyance. After that we found a dirt road, but a major navigational blunder meant we missed the correct trail Sano Jyandan. We didn&#39;t stay at Sano Jyandan, so the rating is for the guesthouse we stayed at in Madre. However, I have left the route going via Sano Jyandan and I would recommend you try to follow it. If anyone has successfully completed this section, please get in touch (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I&#39;d love to integrate your GPS tracks into this route. Note that in the vlog I incorrectly state that we passed Sano Jyandan, in fact our track turns off well before this. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;If you are on steep cliffs you are not high enough. We left the road from Tinsang Kewa at the high point where there are prayer flags. Followed a light animal trail that became a nice trail that continued farther up. It was to the right of your GPX track. No dangerous parts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L053 Warning (3,040 m / 9,980 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We made a huge navigational blunder here. The dirt road follows a switchback to the left, and we assumed it followed the route towards Sano Jyandan. We were wrong and it continued in completely the wrong direction down into the basin to the south. The correct route traverses along the ridge to Sano Jyandan before descending towards the north. As we descended we slowly realised that the road would not be rejoining the correct route, but by the time we fully understood this we had lost significant elevation, and the climb back up to the ridge seemed too far. We continued descending, hoping that the road would eventually lead us west and follow the hillside around towards the north. We realise the road we were on didn&#39;t go that way, but a road below us did head that way, so we bushwhacked down to the lower road. This ended up being a major detour and we ended up staying at a homestay at Madre. I have left the route going to Sano Jyandan, but it should be noted that we didn&#39;t hike it past this waypoint. The route in the GPX file after this point is just copied from the paper maps, so should not be relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L053 Madre (2,080 m / 6,830 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed at a basic guesthouse in Madre, which was the result of a major navigational blunder. I would recommend trying to stick to the route and find Sano Jyandan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L053 Sano Jyandan (2,920 m / 9,570 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the approximate location of Sano Jyandan. We made a major navigational blunder and stayed at Madre instead of here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our navigational blunder from the previous day meant we skipped most of this leg, however I suspect the section we missed is tricky, since there is no trail shown on digital maps. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;We did make it through to Sano Jyandan and on. There are many trails to follow so it took a lot of trial and error. The &amp;ldquo;L054 Trail&amp;rdquo; waypoint marks the beginning of the trail that is the correct route. It is a trail for a while then comes to a road. Both the road and trail go to the same place. The trail is shorter, but very slippery when muddy. There are trails that go in the direction of the GPX route, but they all turned to dead ends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail follows the glacier up to Tillmans Pass, and involves scrambling over glacial boulder fields for most of the day. I believe we made a mistake by following the lateral moraine on the west side of the glacier. A better option would be to get on the east side. This would mean less scrambling since you don&#39;t have to cross a second glacier that joins from the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route crosses crevassed, glaciated terrain. Although not as technical as Tashi Labsta or Amphu Labsta, care is needed. The safest route across Tilman&#39;s Pass may change year-to-year so some mountaineering experience is recommended. Full mountaineering gear is recommended for this leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L061 Tilman&#39;s Pass (5,300 m / 17,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The approach to Tilman&#39;s Pass is up a steep icy glacial slope. When we crossed, crampons and ice axe were sufficient for safety but if conditions were different, ropes may have been needed. The descent was less steep but again if conditions were worse it could be more tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L061 High North Camp (4,550 m / 14,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: After a long scramble down the glacial boulder field we found a reasonably nice campsite here. I believe we hiked further down the glacier than is indicated on the paper maps, but I would recommend pushing on to here because it&#39;s a nice flat grassy area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had major problems here. The route before the Langtang Khola crossing is very wild - no trail on the ground and often bushwhacking through dense shrubland. Moving through this terrain is slow and frustrating. We descended the Langshisha Khola from High North Camp on the west moraine towards Langshisha Kharka. This was a bad decision because the only bridge over the Langtang Khola was on the east side of the Langshisha Khola. We spent most of the day bushwhacking back up the Langshisha Khola through dense shrubland to find a safe place to cross, only to give up and return to Langshisha Kharka to camp overnight. We continued searching early the next morning, hoping the water would be lower. It was noticeably lower but still too dangerous to cross. Our party split up, and the two others managed to cross the Langshisha Khola nearer the glacier. Mathi and I eventually made a very dangerous crossing of the Langtang Khola assisted by a rope. We were swept away by the fast flowing river and dragged to safety by the others on the opposite side. This was a really bad idea and not recommended in the slightest. I have updated the route to immediately descend from High North Camp and cross the Langshisha Khola as soon as possible. Be very careful descending from High North Camp towards the Langshisha Khola - in October 2021 Eyal experienced very difficult terrain and dangerous avalanche conditions here and had a bad fall. Take your time and be prepared to backtrack to find a safer route. Once you&#39;re across the Langshisha Khola, the route continues down on the east side to the bridge. Be aware that this was the situation in spring 2019, and the bridge may have been changed (update in October 2021: the bridge is still there). Also with less water in the river this could have been a completely different experience. After you cross the Langtang Khola to the north bank you pick up the Langtang trail which is well maintained and easy to follow. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where your GPX marks that you go down to the river has been taken out by landslides. At this part we went back up to the left parallel to the river until it flattened out a bit. We crossed one landslide gully and then followed the second one down to the river. We had no visibility so one might be able to see a better route. We had no problems on the climb down, but I imagine it is constantly changing. We were able to cross the river just upstream from where we reached the river and had no problems on the east side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L062 Cross (4,410 m / 14,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Although we didn&#39;t hike this way, my advice is to cross the Langshisha Khola approximately here, as high as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L062 Langshisha Khola (4,240 m / 13,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Langshisha Khola is the drainage river of the Langshisha Glacier that yesterday&#39;s route follows. My advice is to cross this as soon as possible and descend on the east bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care to find where the footpath diverges from the road. We made a navigational blunder by following the road too far. The road leads to Tipling but switchbacks mean it is 29km long instead of 14km on the footpath. In the end we bushwhacked for an hour back to the footpath. Once you&#39;re on the footpath it&#39;s relatively easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a different route via Dharot, but this is not recommended. Jeff (2025) found a better route so I&#39;ve updated this leg to follow his track. Jeff: &amp;ldquo;The first part of the climb is on a nice new trail, then it turns to an older shepherd&#39;s Trail before hitting the pass. From the pass the nice new trail continues north and connects to Khorlabeshi. I&#39;d recommend people take this path as it looks nicer. Probably no water until the bottom though. My track continues down the pass off trail for a few hundred meters (waypoint &amp;ldquo;L069 Jeff&amp;rdquo;) until it connects with a new road down to the hydro works. From there you can follow it to Kashigaun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy hike along a well maintained trail. We did an alternative route from the section from Manang to Kagbeni. We had both hiked the standard route via Thorong La before, so instead we hiked to Tilicho Lake and over Mesokanto La to Jomson and on to Kagbeni. This is an excellent option if you want a more remote route. It involves two nights of camping and some tricky to follow trails. I will include trail notes for this option at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very tricky to follow trail, which was steep with slippery crumbling slate fragments underfoot in places. We made a navigational blunder by following what looked like a horse track on the ground. This led in the wrong direction and we then chose a dangerous exposed traverse instead of backtracking (the route does not take this detour). Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The shelter at Sangda Phedi has collapsed as of 2021. The river was easily crossable without needing to get wet feet. We had no navigational issues in this section as the trail was well traveled and some of it was road.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Sangda Phedi (5,150 m / 16,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We stayed overnight at a nice shelter in Sangda Phedi just before the ascent to Jungben La. If you stay overnight here, take note of the options for crossing the river in the morning. When we crossed there was a partially broken bridge, and although the river was shallow, we had to get wet feet. An early morning start at over 5,000m meant that it was well below freezing, and getting wet was very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Jungben La (5,550 m / 18,200 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: From the river a very easy 400m ascent up a gravel slope leads to Jungben La.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L086 Nulungsumda Kharka (4,970 m / 16,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We didn&#39;t actually stay overnight here, but after the descent from Niwas La the terrain flattens out and there is a flat grassy area here. We saw some herders in tents here so you may also be able to get food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a huge problem here. The trail on the east side of the Thansan Khola was blocked. We backtracked and camped overnight at Norbulung. In the morning we made a very bad decision. I believe the best way would have been to continue towards Chharka Bhot on the west bank after crossing the Thansan Khola. I would recommend doing this, and have left the route going this way to Chharka Bhot even though we didn&#39;t go this way. We made the decision to hike up the Yalku Khola, heading towards one of the passes near Chharka Bhot. The upper parts of the Yalku Khola were not passable, and the pass we were aiming for didn&#39;t look safe at all. We changed plans several times, and ended up hiking for two days over mountainous terrain with no trails on the map or the ground. The route we took skipped Chharka Bhot entirely and continued directly west across the mountains to the Chap Chu East waypoint, camping overnight at Sipalun Kharka. This part of the route was relatively easy with no particularly dangerous terrain. However, the problem is that you arrive at Chap Chu on the east side of the Bharbun Khola. There is no bridge and when we were there (August 16th) the river was far too swollen to cross. After taking advice from some Yak herders, we followed a rough trail south to Sinjik expecting the water to be lower, however this was incorrect and in fact the water was higher. Sinjik was deserted with a few derelict buildings, and as far as we could see the path finished there and we couldn&#39;t go any further south. We were out of options and about to give up when a local man appeared and led us along the most perilous trails I&#39;ve ever hiked in my life. Slippery rocks with certain death falls inches away. I would highly recommend not trying to repeat this route! After a couple of hours we arrived in Thinmer where we stayed overnight in a basic homestay. Thinmer has a bridge over the Bharbun Khola, and the trail north to Chap Chu on the west side of the river was safe and well maintained. If you would like our detailed GPS tracks for this route, you can find them in our raw GPX logs (days 123-126), however be warned that the section from Sinjik to Thinmer was exceedingly dangerous and I would absolutely not repeat it myself. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where you marked the trail as blocked there is actually a road on the west side of the river now. It crosses back to the east after maybe a kilometer. The rest of the way is an easy road.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Thansan Khola (4,680 m / 15,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Thansan Khola flows north towards Chharka Bhot, and all digital / printed maps show a trail following the east bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Cross (4,760 m / 15,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The Thansan Khola is shallow at this point and we easily crossed (August 15th). My recommendation is to cross here to the west side and continue to Chharka Bhot this way. Note we didn&#39;t hike this way, so the route is only approximate and you may need to cross the river again before reaching Chharka Bhot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;no-page-break&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Blocked (4,730 m / 15,500 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The trail on the east side of the Thansan Khola was blocked here. With less water in the river it may be possible to pass this point by wading in the water, but when we were here (August 15th) it was completely impossible. Note that we didn&#39;t hike past this point, but I have left the route going this way as per the digital / paper maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Yalku Khola (4,850 m / 15,900 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We made a bad decision to follow the Yalku Khola upstream trying to find an alternative route to Chharka Bhot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Sinjik (4,080 m / 13,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: We were expecting to be able to stay overnight in a homestay in Sinjik, but the buildings were all derelict and nobody was living there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L087 Thinmer (4,050 m / 13,300 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The path we followed south from Sinjik to Thinmer was extremely dangerous and I would not repeat it. Thinmer is a small village and we stayed overnight in basic homestay. There is a bridge over the Bharbun Khola at Thinmer and the trail leading north towards Chap Chu on the west side is safe and well maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme care should be taken if hiking this route from Chharka Bhot to Chap Chu. We did not hike this way, and the route is just copied from the paper maps. There is no trail shown on digital maps, which usually indicates the trail on the ground is tenuous or non-existent. The guidebook mentions there are several crossings of the Bharbun Khola required with no bridge. We only saw that river south (downstream) of Chap Chu, but I would expect crossing it would have been impossible even further upstream when we were there (August 16th). The guidebook and paper maps mention an alternative trail that takes a more remote northerly route from Chharka Bhot to Dho Tarap via Mola La (5030m) and Jhyarkoi La (5360m). I suggest you talk to locals at Chharka Bhot and work out the best option considering the current conditions. It may be possible to arrange a local guide - I would highly recommend that. Again I must stress that I believe this leg would have been impossible when we were here (August 16th) due to the river being too swollen. If you find a reliable, safe route through this section, please contact me (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I would love to use your GPS tracks and trail notes here. Update from Kate (2012): &amp;ldquo;Most of this section is also road now. The only trail section is the last ~5k to Chap Chu. We had no dangerous river crossings and no trouble following the trail (Sept 2, 2021). Charka Bhot had a couple guesthouses, but we only stopped for lunch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg was extremely tricky, and required long sections of bushwhacking through dense shrubland. There were several crossings of a river, which was small enough that we managed to avoid getting our feet wet by hopping across rocks. As soon as we climbed above the treeline the terrain become easier to traverse and a trail on the ground became apparent. The ascent to the pass and the descent into Dho Tarap were much easier to navigate. There are several small rivers crossings with no bridges, but none were more than ankle deep (August 19th). Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Part of this is also road. We had no navigational issues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L089 Chan La (5,380 m / 17,600 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: The ascent to Chan La was relatively easy. The slope leading to the pass was steep gravel but the trail was well worn and provided good footing. Again on the descent the trail proved easy to follow and stable underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L089 Dho Tarap (4,080 m / 13,400 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: Dho Tarap is a paradise of rolling green pastures and fields of crops. The town is very basic but there is one nice clean guesthouse where we stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of this leg was a very easy hike up a wide flat river valley along a well maintained trail. As soon as we turned right up the narrow gorge it completely changed. This section was extremely technical, scrambling up 900m of elevation over large rock obstacles. It involved dangerous leaps between rocks to cross the river numerous times. There was no trail marked on the ground, and we had to backtrack several times to find safer places to cross the river. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The narrow gorge has a very nice trail. We had no scrambling and no dangerous leaps between rocks. There were bridges for most of the river crossings. We had to ford a couple, but it was only knee deep at most (August 28, 2021). There is a new looking shelter about 500m after Pass Camp. Locals were happy to share the space with us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we made a navigational error when departing Pho. We headed approximately north towards the rightmost of two chortens that were visible in the distance from the village. After passing the chorten, the trail stopped and we spent the three hours bushwhacking across steep shrubland to the ridge. If I was to hike this leg again I&#39;d try aiming for the leftmost chorten and hope that the trail continues all the way to the ridge. When we reached the ridge, we found a trail that seemed to come from the south from the general direction of Pho, so I believe this was an easier route. However the terrain was relatively open so the section of bushwhacking didn&#39;t post any significant dangers. I have left the route following our track. If you find a better route through this section, please contact me (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave@brophy.uk&#34;&gt;dave@brophy.uk&lt;/a&gt;) because I would love to use your GPS track. Once we reached the ridge, we found a trail that was relatively easy to follow. Take note of the waypoint that marks the descent from the ridge because it may be easy to miss. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;The trail to the left is the correct trail. Easy to follow when you’re on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L098 Climb (4,820 m / 15,800 ft)&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe we made a navigational blunder here. This waypoint marks where we started climbing up the steep grassy hill towards the pass. After half an hour of bushwhacking we came across a well trodden trail coming from the south. I believe that this trail ascends from the valley starting further south from this waypoint, and you should try to find it. The gradient was very steep on this section and a fall would have been very bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a string of bad decisions today that resulted in the most dangerous situation of the trek. We missed a trail and continued hiking down the Chyandi Khola directly next to the river. As we continued the banks became increasingly steep and we had to pass increasingly dangerous obstacles to continue following the river. As the number of perilous situations we encountered grew, the prospect of backtracking through them again seemed more and more problematic. In the end, it was impossible to continue, and we made the decision to climb out of the river gorge up a steep bank. This was utterly idiotic and could have easily cost us our lives. We had no idea what was above us, and the terrain was so steep that we were basically rock climbing with no safety equipment. When we reached the top of the ridge, we found a well trodden trail that led down to a bridge over the Kaitpuchonam Khola. Neither of us were in any mood for more adventures, so we camped as soon as we crossed the bridge. I have adjusted the route to follow where I&#39;m guessing the trail comes from, but be aware that we completely missed it, so this is very approximate. We completed the rest of this leg to Takla Khola the next day, which was tricky to follow and very steep in places. Update from Kate (2021): &amp;ldquo;Where you marked that you missed the trail that goes up the north bank is actually about where you should cross the river to the south bank. The trail goes in and out especially at the beginning, but just follow the river. There is a bridge that crosses the Chyandi Khola right by where the other bridge crosses the Kaitpuchonam Khola. We were going west to east and tried to find a trail on the north side of the river, but everything we tried cliffed out. We could see the second bridge and decided to go for it. Had no problems following the river on the south side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Every day I made a vlog video of the trek. I&#39;ve finally got them ready to show the world.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2019 we spent five months hiking the Great Himalaya Trail across Nepal. Every day I made a vlog video of the trek. I&#39;ve finally got them ready to show the world. Here&#39;s the trailer - the vlog episodes start on February 1st. Feel free to subscribe / share. This has been a huge project over the past few months and I&#39;m super happy with the result!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;My satellite tracker will allow you to follow along and watch my progress.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set sail December 30th 2019 and will be returning to Argentina on about January 31st 2020. My Garmin InReach satellite tracker will update this map every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send me a short message by clicking the &lt;em&gt;Message&lt;/em&gt; button. If you have a Garmin InReach, you can use the Garmin address &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:dave8@inreach.garmin.com&#34;&gt;dave8@inreach.garmin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Sailing from the southern tip of Argentina to the Antarctic peninsula for a ski-mountaineering expedition.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 30th December 2019 I&#39;ll be sailing from the southern tip of Argentina to the Antarctic peninsula for a
month long expedition. After three days crossing the infamous Drake Passage we&#39;ll be heading inland on skis,
dragging sleds across the glaciers, to set up base-camp. We&#39;ll spend a couple of weeks camped on the ice and
plan to summit some previously unclimbed peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Models</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/models/</link>

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;3D models for each day of the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. We didn&#39;t use the 3D models on the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://maps3d.io/&#34;&gt;Maps3d.io&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing service that easily converts a GPX route into a GLTF format 3D model, using satellite imagery and elevation data. These can be displayed on the web (as below) or in a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve downloaded models for all 115 days to my phone, so while we&#39;re on the trek we should be able to preview the next section in glorious 3D. It makes visualising the route so much easier than looking at a topo map. I&#39;ve been using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vispolygon.com/&#34;&gt;glTFShowcase&lt;/a&gt; app to view the models on my phone. You can find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cjp3cn26qqxgx6g/AAAyDiNInCspvUKdjmAKPodna?dl=0&#34;&gt;Dropbox folder here&lt;/a&gt; containing all the models if you want to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a day from the itinerary and the model will load below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;select onchange=&#34;changeModel(this)&#34; id=&#34;modelSelect&#34;&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://preview.babylonjs.com/viewer/babylon.viewer.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;vh75&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    let sel = document.getElementById(&#34;modelSelect&#34;);
	for (let i = 1; i &lt; 116; i++) {
	    const special = (i == 88 || i == 89);
	    const count = special ? 2 : 1;
	    for (let j = 0; j &lt; count; j++) {
	        var suffix = &#34;&#34;;
	        if (special &amp;&amp; j == 0) {
	            suffix = &#34;n&#34;;
			} else if (special &amp;&amp; j == 1) {
                suffix = &#34;s&#34;;
			}
            var opt = document.createElement(&#39;option&#39;);
            const name = &#34;D&#34;+(i+&#34;&#34;).padStart(3, &#34;0&#34;)+suffix;
            opt.appendChild(document.createTextNode(name));
            opt.value = name;
            sel.appendChild(opt);
        }
	}
    var items = sel.getElementsByTagName(&#39;option&#39;);
    var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    sel.selectedIndex = index;
    let name = sel.options[sel.selectedIndex].value;

    let domElement = document.getElementById(&#39;babylonViewer&#39;);

    let viewer = new BabylonViewer.DefaultViewer(domElement, {

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5,308m, D061&lt;/em&gt; - Navigation on the approach to Tilman&#39;s is reportedly rather difficult. It&#39;s less technical than the other passes and lower elevation at just 5,308m. A steep scramble beside an icefall is followed by an crevassed plateau, then a steep scramble down. The exit is a long walk along a glacier with a tricky river crossing at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5,760m, D043&lt;/em&gt; - The route over Tashi Labsta La is a rocky scramble with constant danger from rockfall and crevasses. We&#39;ll have to be very careful on this section, but it&#39;s perhaps less technical than the previous three passes.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;One of the most dangerous passes in Nepal and the most technical part of the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5,845m, D031&lt;/em&gt; - Amphu Labsta La is reportedly one of the most dangerous passes in Nepal, and certainly the most technical point on our trek. Climbing a steep icefall will require full climbing safety gear, and the descent is just as tricky with a 30m rappel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&#34;height:75vh;&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen src=&#34;https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/untitled-map_307234?scaleControl=false&amp;miniMap=false&amp;scrollWheelZoom=false&amp;zoomControl=true&amp;allowEdit=false&amp;moreControl=false&amp;searchControl=null&amp;tilelayersControl=null&amp;embedControl=null&amp;datalayersControl=null&amp;onLoadPanel=undefined&amp;captionBar=false&amp;fullscreenControl=null&amp;datalayers=809606#13/27.8822/86.9035&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6,190m, D029&lt;/em&gt; - The top of West Col is the highest point on the trek at 6,190m, but doesn&#39;t involve much climbing from the plateau. However a 200m rappel awaits on the other side. I&#39;ve read disconcerting reports about the state of the fixed ropes on this section, so extreme care will have to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The first, and perhaps most difficult mountaineering section on our route.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6,180m, D028&lt;/em&gt; - Sherpani &amp;amp; West Col are two impressive passes connected by a glaciated plateau. The ascent of Sherpani is a tough scramble followed by some easy rock climbing, followed by a 35m rappel down to the plateau. Rockfall from above and crevasses will be a constant danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidebook and most of the itineraries I&#39;ve found recommend spending the night on the plateau between the two passes. However most of the descriptions from smaller groups recommend pushing through in a single day. It seems when you&#39;re trekking with a small army of porters and support staff then the long rappel at the West Col takes several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;What we know about the mountaineering sections we&#39;ll be tackling.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the mountaineering sections on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/&#34;&gt;Trail Notes page&lt;/a&gt;.
Also check out the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-are-the-most-difficult--technical-parts&#34;&gt;What are the most difficult / technical parts?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route has five passes that require moderate mountaineering skills and equipment. You can read more about the gear we&#39;ll be using on these sections on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-mountaineering/&#34;&gt;Gear - Mountaineering&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be enlisting the services of a mountaineering guide to assist us over these five sections - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/sherpani-col/&#34;&gt;Sherpani Col&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/west-col/&#34;&gt;West Col&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/amphu-labsta-la/&#34;&gt;Amphu Labsta La&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tashi-labsta-la/&#34;&gt;Tashi Labsta La&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tilmans-pass/&#34;&gt;Tilman&#39;s Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mountaineering guide, Zangmu Sherpa is from the Everest Makalu area has provided assistance in 8000m+ mountain climbs. He has crossed Sherpani Col, West Col, Amphu Labsta, and Tashi Labsta five times times, so should be an excellent guide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Trash</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trash/</link>

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;A pledge on dealing with our plastic trash.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to ship all out trash back to Kathmandu, however the cost of shipping it out of the country was
prohibitively expensive so we disposed of it in Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our backpacking food arrived I&#39;ve been getting more and more concerned about the amount of plastic trash we&#39;ll be generating. The remote regions of Nepal have very limited rubbish disposal facilities, and plastic trash is often dumped. I was constantly depressed by the trash littering the trails when I hiked the Annapurna Circuit last year. So I&#39;m going to make a pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-pledge&#34;&gt;Our pledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&#39;t leave any plastic trash in Nepal. We will leave the country with all the plastic we arrived with. Our resupply packages will be delivered by a porter who will return to Kathmandu with all our trash. We will store it in Kathmandu, and at the end of the trek I will return to the UK with the whole lot and send it to be recycled.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Communication</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/communication/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;How we&#39;ll be communicating with the outside world.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My InReach Mini worked flawlessly throughout the trek and should be considered absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553075075/garmin-inreach-mini.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be using a Garmin InReach Mini for communicating with the outside world during the trek. It uses the Iridium satellite network to allow two-way short message communication anywhere in the world, even when far away from a mobile network. It has several useful features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;messaging&#34;&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can send and receive short, 140 character messages. Messages are sent from the outside world using a simple web form - feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/&#34;&gt;send us a message&lt;/a&gt;. Outgoing messages are usually created on a phone with bluetooth connection, but in an emergency can be composed on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-updates&#34;&gt;Social updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can send messages to a preset Twitter / Facebook feed. Unfortunately the Facebook integration needs to be refreshed every 90 days so won&#39;t work for our trek, but Twitter seems to work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-tracking&#34;&gt;Live tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can update a live &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/&#34;&gt;tracking map&lt;/a&gt; with an automatic track point every few minutes, manual waypoints or short messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emergency-sos&#34;&gt;Emergency SOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emergency, an SOS button automaticlly alerts a central emergency control center that can contact search and rescue services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather-reports&#34;&gt;Weather reports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weather report can be requested. The response shows a pretty basic weather report for the next few days. The reports unfortunately show temperature at a mystery elevation instead of the freezing level so they&#39;re of limited use in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The temperatures we&#39;ll be experiencing on the trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These temperatures worked pretty well as a very rough estimate. See the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#whats-the-temperature-like&#34;&gt;What&#39;s the temperature like?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s possible to work out the approximate temperatures on the trail by taking the average monthly temperatures in Kathmandu at 1,400m, and using the adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8C per km. This gives us a very approximate estimate of the temperature we&#39;ll be experiencing on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show we&#39;ll be expecting a rather chilly -20C on some nights, but daytime temperatures rarely dip below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-clothes/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-clothes/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The clothes I&#39;ll be taking on the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our clothes worked pretty well throughout the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clothes&#34;&gt;Clothes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll take a single change of underwear and long-sleeve t-shirt - both Icebreaker merino wool. I&#39;ll take a pair of Darn Tough socks for the warmer sections and a warmer pair of Smartwool socks for the cold sections. The boots I&#39;ll be using aren&#39;t particularly warm so I&#39;ll need the extra insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553077828/36515_BALB.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it gets cold I&#39;ll be slipping into my Patagonia Capilene Air thermal layer, which is incredibly light for the warmth it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single pair of hiking pants will have to do - I&#39;ve gone for the lightweight Arcteryx Gamma LT. This will be far too cold in the cold bits, but when supplemented with thermals and a shell pants it should just be good enough. I&#39;m not expecting to do much hiking in my down pants, but it&#39;s an option if it&#39;s too cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553077947/Acto-FL-Jacket-Everglade.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arcteryx Acto FL is a great all-round hardfleece jacket. The material is a thin fleecy material on the inside, with a smooth outer face giving just enough insulation and wind resistance. It makes a great outer layer for cool conditions and also a mid layer when it gets colder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553078003/Cerium-SV-Hoody-Pilot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll take the Arcteryx Cerium SV as a down jacket - should give enough warmth for the very coldest parts, and supplement my 20F (-7C) summer sleeping bag if I decide to take that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll use a pair of down pants, down slippers and waterproof over-boots from Goose Feet Gear - this is also mainly for use while camping rather than hiking. They&#39;re still to arrive as I write this&amp;hellip; I&#39;m rather excited to finally receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553078219/0b1b7b306771d8f794da6f5dccce4201-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a shell I&#39;ll use the Arcteryx Beta LT jacket and the Alpha SL pants (or perhaps my Beta SL pants depending on how they fit over my down pants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessories&#34;&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Diamond HeavyWeight ScreenTap gloves are an excellent all-round fleece glove. They work perfectly on my phone and should be quick drying&amp;hellip; I&#39;ll take two pairs in case one gets wet. As a windproof layer over them I&#39;ll use an old pair of Arcteryx Beta Shell gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553080119/zoom_Tuff_Bags_GTX.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For when it gets really cold I have a pair of PHD Minimus Down Mitts and Extremities Tuff Bags Goretex shell mittens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553080309/icolor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll bring an excellent sun hat from ICOLOR, which has full 360 degree face and neck protection when needed. I used this one in Nepal last year and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had an Outdoor Designs &amp;ldquo;Windiush&amp;rdquo; Polartec Wind Pro hat for years but never found the perfect opportunity to use it - it should keep my head happy in the wildest of storms. Unfortunately not in production any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footwear&#34;&gt;Footwear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footwear was one of the most difficult decisions I&#39;ve had to make, and compounded by the fact I have rather unusual shaped feet. Shoes are usually far too narrow for my feet at the front, causing all sorts of painful problems on long treks. Last year I used the Arcteryx Bora2 hiking boots. I love the removable inner - you can dry it out overnight when it gets damp. However they were never the most comfortable boots. All Arcteryx footwear I&#39;ve tried over the years suffers from the same problem of a narrow fore-foot. Also for the hotter sections my feet were uncomfortably warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail will be incredibly varied - the lower sections will be hot, humid - almost rainforest conditions. The mountain passes will have snow, and some sections will require crampons. Getting one perfect pair of boots to do the whole range of conditions will be nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553088730/s-lab-xa-alpine-2__L40214000.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying on 8 different pairs of shoes / boots I&#39;ve settled on the Salomon XA Alpine 2. They&#39;re a lightweight trail running shoe (based on Salomon&#39;s Sense platform) with a permanently attached gaiter. Not completely waterproof but the gaiter should discourage most of the water from getting in&amp;hellip; and they should be relatively quick to dry. They have a reinforced section in the sole that improves their performance with crampons - but in my testing they were still rather flexible. They&#39;re probably just good enough for the technical sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be fording several rivers, so I&#39;ll take a pair of Skinners sock / shoe hybrids. These are the lightest shoe I could find that will just about give me protection from sharp objects while wading. I&#39;ll probably use the footbeds from my hiking shoes inside them for extra protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also take a pair of Salomon Trail Gaiters, which should make hiking in deep snow easier, locking my shell pants down and preventing snow from getting inside.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our miscellaneous gear.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had major problems with solar panels. The Suntactics S5-Lite was underpowered and almost completely useless. We
switched to using the 21W panels at one of the early resupply points, however these also caused problems. See the FAQ:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#power&#34;&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the water sources along the trek are silty and would clog a filter, so we switched to using chlorine tablets at
the first resupply point and continued like this for the rest of the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553075263/panel-cropped.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be taking a Suntactics S5-Lite solar panel, and an Anker 13,000 mAh power bank. This is rather an unknown for me - I&#39;ve never done a trek that relied on solar charging before. During the Annapurna Circuit last year, it was quite common to have power provided in the tea houses, but I&#39;ve heard this isn&#39;t the case for much of the country. I&#39;d like to be as self-sufficient as possible so the solar panel is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553075075/garmin-inreach-mini.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be taking a Garmin InReach satellite communicator. I&#39;ve had three iterations of the InReach devices, and they&#39;ve got better each time. This version is almost identical in functionality but much smaller and lighter than it&#39;s predecessors. It uses the Iridium satellite network to send or receive short messages, even when without a mobile network. You can read more about the features on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/communication/&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/a&gt; page. We&#39;ll use it to communicate with our logistical assistance company, and to post regular updates to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553075375/s1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll use the Sawyer Micro water filter to clean stream water - it attaches perfectly to the Cnoc Vecto bladders we&#39;ll be carrying. It&#39;s worth remembering that these filters can be damaged by freezing, so we&#39;ll have to store it inside our sleeping bag overnight on the cold nights. We&#39;ll take chlorine tablets for 100L of water in case we lose the filter - that will easily take us to the next resupply stop where we can get a replacement filter delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll take a small, light USB adapter to recharge all our devices and power bang when mains is available. Some small 5g ESBIT fire starting tablets will come in handy when building a campfire. The Opinel knife we&#39;ll take is all we need, and incredibly lightweight. We&#39;ll also take 10m of 2mm Dyneema accessory cord (the same as I&#39;ve used as guy-lines on the tent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental floss and a sewing needle is useful for repairs to gear. Nitecore NU32 headlamps are a great light source, recharging from USB. We&#39;ll organise all the misc gear in a Zpacks DCF dry-bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be using Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z hiking poles, which are a great lightweight non-adjustable pole.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-mountaineering/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our mountaineering gear for the technical passes.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hugely regret not taking my crampons and ice axe on the first section (from Kanchenjunga Base Camp to Makalu Base
Camp). The first few high sections (Nango La, Lumbha Sumbha, Molun Pokhari) were all extremely dangerous without
crampons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mountaineering gear all worked extremely well, however I think we were lucky that our Petzl Leopard crampons lasted
the whole trek. The Dyneema cord joining the front and back of the crampons together was badly worn from walking across
rocks, and could have snapped at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553073044/leopard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve chosen the lightest mountaineering gear available. Although we&#39;ll only be using it for five days, we&#39;ll be carrying it for several weeks of hiking, so weight is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing mountaineering gear, it&#39;s worth setting expectations on the limitations. Lighter weight gear won&#39;t be as capable as heavier. We&#39;re expecting some steep snowy scrambles, rappels from fixed ropes, perhaps rappels with our own ropes from pre-existing anchors, and glacier travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our gear probably won&#39;t be quite up to dealing with steep bare ice, and we won&#39;t have enough spare gear to be making our own rappel anchors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553073169/s_IDOL%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petzl Leopard crampons, although made of less durable alloy should be fine, and will fit all types of boot. The Ice Rock Idol ice axe isn&#39;t the most substantial tool, and bizarrely light at 190g, but it should be ok for the tasks we have. Harness, belay plate, carabiners and slings are all standard climbing safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prussics are interesting. We&#39;ll take my 30m Petzl RAD Line to Nepal and make a call on whether we use it once we&#39;ve met the mountaineering guide. I&#39;d like to be capable of a rappel without relying on the guides equipment if possible. In this situation, a prussic that grips the skinny 6mm RAD line is essential. The Sterling HollowBlock2 is perfect tool for this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553073347/ONECOL.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the RAD Line I&#39;ll also take 30m of 2mm Dyneema accessory cord. With this we can retrive the rope if we need to do a 30m rappel with the 30m rope (with the accessory cord attached to a biner-blocker knot at the top).&lt;/p&gt;

            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-cooking/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our stove, pot and water storage.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cooking system worked pretty well. One problem was that the Kovea Spider stove was tricky to keep alight with even
the slightest wind, so I would probably swap for a more windproof stove if I was to do the trek again. It never got
cold enough that we had to invert the canister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553070182/KOV-KB-1109-00-846x846.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve chosen to take a canister stove - we&#39;ll be getting regular resupply packages that will replenish our gas supplies, so a heavy complex liquid fuel stove won&#39;t be needed. However, we&#39;re still confirming that it&#39;ll be possible to get the gas canisters delivered to the last two resupply points in Ringmo and Gamgadhi. We were initially planning to send the resupply packages by internal flight from Kathmandu, but gas canisters aren&#39;t allowed on any flights. We&#39;re trying to find a solution to this but we may need to swap over to a liquid fuel stove for the last month of the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the Kovea Spider - well built and very lightweight for a remote canister stove. The remote canister and pre-burner allows the canister to be inverted feeding liquid directly to the stove. The liquid fuel passes through the preheater loop which vaporizes is before burning. This allows the stove to operate at lower temperatures than normal canister stoves. The titanium wind break from Scramble is custom made for this stove and weighs only 25g. Unfortunately the normal storage method of curling it up inside your pot doesn&#39;t work for us because we will be using the pot to make protein shake for lunch, so I&#39;ve had to make a cardboard sheath that will protect the rest of our pack contents from the razor sharp titanium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553070706/titanium-bot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re using a Vargo Titanium Bot, which is a titanium pot with a watertight screw top. This weighs a bit more than a standard pot, but allows us to make the Huel protein shake we&#39;ll be having for lunch. The Vargo Bot has a great 15g hanging accessory that&#39;ll allow us to boil water over a campfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re estimating the stove will use approximately 15g of gas per litre of water. That will give us 15 litres of water per 230g canister. Our hot water consumption should be under a litre per day, so each canister should last 15 days. We will change cylinder every 10 days to give us a healthy margin - the stove will be less efficient with wind, low temperatures etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the side pockets of our pack we&#39;ll have two 1L Nalgene HDPE bottles. These are much heavier than the standard disposable water bottles I&#39;d usually carry, but the DCF dry-bags I&#39;m mounting to the side of the pack mean we need a water bottle with a flat top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553070803/3L2018vectofrontsq_1200x.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be carrying the excellent Cnoc Vecto water bladder, which has the correct screw thread to attach directly to the Sawyer water filters, and a wide opening for ease of filling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tableizer-container&#34;&gt; &lt;table class=&#34;tableizer-table&#34;&gt; &lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class=&#34;tableizer-firstrow&#34;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;kg&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[http://kovea.com/product/spider/](http://kovea.com/product/spider/ &#34;http://kovea.com/product/spider/&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kovea Spider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.173&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;230g gas canister&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[https://seatosummit.com/product/alphalight-long-handled-spoon/](https://seatosummit.com/product/alphalight-long-handled-spoon/ &#34;https://seatosummit.com/product/alphalight-long-handled-spoon/&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sea to Summit Alpha Light Spoon - Long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.011&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plastic mug&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.047&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-bottle-pot.html](https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-bottle-pot.html &#34;https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-bottle-pot.html&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vargo Titanium Bot 1L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.144&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-hanger.html](https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-hanger.html &#34;https://www.vargooutdoors.com/titanium-bot-hanger.html&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vargo Titanium Bot Hanger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[https://giantpygmy.net/shop/index.php?id_product=41&amp;controller=product](https://giantpygmy.net/shop/index.php?id_product=41&amp;controller=product &#34;https://giantpygmy.net/shop/index.php?id_product=41&amp;controller=product&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scramble Spider Windshield&lt;/a&gt; (with cardboard sheath)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.057&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 x &lt;a href=&#34;[https://www.nalgene.com/product/2179-0032/](https://www.nalgene.com/product/2179-0032/ &#34;https://www.nalgene.com/product/2179-0032/&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1L Nalgene HDPE Wide Mouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.216&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;750ml disposable Evian bottle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.031&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;[https://cnocoutdoors.com/products/2019-vecto-3l-28mm](https://cnocoutdoors.com/products/2019-vecto-3l-28mm &#34;https://cnocoutdoors.com/products/2019-vecto-3l-28mm&#34;)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cnoc Outdoors Vecto 3L Water Container&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.088&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-sleeping/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our sleeping bags, pads and accessories.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sleep system worked extremely well. We used the Feathered Friends Snowbunting sleeping bags for the first sections,
and as the temperature increased we swapped to the much lighter Zpacks bags. We didn&#39;t get much use out of the Evazote
foam pads, so sent these hope at the first resupply point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553069153/snowbunting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had initially intended to use my Zpacks 20F (-7C) sleeping bags, augmented with down jacket and pants. However, after working out the overnight temperatures we&#39;ll be facing (as low as -20C) I changed my mind and we&#39;ll be taking my Feathered Friends Snowbunting 0F (-17C) sleeping bags. They&#39;re not particularly lightweight at around 1.3kg, and don&#39;t pack down very small. We&#39;ll take both models to Nepal and possible swap to the lighter ones for the warmer sections. I may still take my lighter sleeping bag for the first section where I&#39;m hiking solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553089191/matelas-gonflable-neoair-xtherm-regular-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sleeping pad we&#39;ll be taking the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xtherm - the standard winter inflatable sleeping pad. We&#39;ll also take a thin Evazote foam pad cut to the size of the inflatable pad. This will give protection from sharp objects, stop the inflatable pad from sliding on the DCF floor, and also work well as a camp seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll have the Trekology Ultralight Pillow - they seem to be pretty comfortable and were much cheaper than the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tableizer-container&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tableizer-table&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class=&#34;tableizer-firstrow&#34;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;kg&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-camping/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our tent, pegs and accessories.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a problem with the zip of our tent, but overall it performed well. The downside of a large tent like this is
that it needs a lot of space to set up. There were several campsites where we needed to take extra time to scout out a
sufficiently large spot to erect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553069212/20170825_092334.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be sleeping in a Hyperlite Mountain Gear Ultamid 4, which is a extremely sturdy four-season pyramid tent made of ultra light DCF fabric. The outer tent is as basic as you can imagine - just a four-sided pyramid of single-layer DCF with nothing else. No floor, no inner tent, no bug protection. In the high mountains you don&#39;t really need an inner tent - a lightweight plastic ground sheet will do just fine. However in the lower elevations where bugs and torrential rain become a problem, an insert is advisable. We&#39;ll be taking the Hyperlite Mountain Gear Insert with DCF11 floor. This gives us full protection from bugs and a nice high bathtub floor that should keep us dry even in the most torrential monsoon rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553071000/ultamid-insert.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three weeks when I&#39;m hiking solo I&#39;ll be leaving the inner tent behind - I just don&#39;t have space to fit it in my pack. Instead I&#39;ll take a Gossamer Gear Polycryo Ground Cloth and the lightest mosquito net I could find. It&#39;s only the first few days I&#39;ll be needing the mosquito net since the rest of the first section is high and cold enough that they won&#39;t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pegs we&#39;re using the Ruta Locura carbon fibre Sorex stakes. The 9 inch version for the outer tent and 6 inch for the inner. I&#39;m rather worried about pitching in soft snow, but snow pegs are too heavy for such a long trek, so we&#39;ll have to make do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tableizer-container&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tableizer-table&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class=&#34;tableizer-firstrow&#34;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;kg&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;My pack and accessories.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arc Blast is a great pack, but never designed for more than about 10kg. We were regularly carrying loads of 20kg,
and the hip belt was extremely uncomfortable. I had bruises on my hips for several months after the end of the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553066808/arc-azure-angle-l.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be using the ZPacks Arc Blast. This is my third Arc Blast and without a doubt my favourite ever pack. The feather light 605g combined with the amazing load isolation is an unbeatable combination. However, for this trek it has proved difficult. It&#39;s the main compartment of the pack is only 42L, and with 10 days of food, a winter sleeping bag, half the tent and some group gear it&#39;s completely full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sleeping pad, spare clothes and personal gear just won&#39;t fit. After much shuffling, I&#39;ve decided to attach three Zpacks tall dry-bags to the outside of the pack. The alternative is to take a larger, heavier pack but I&#39;d like to avoid this if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can just about fit everything I need in the Arc Blast with attached dry-bags. It&#39;s worth noting that ten days is the maximum amount of food that we&#39;ll be carrying, and as we gradually eat it, more space will become available in the main compartment and I can migrate items inside. I&#39;m not a great fan of hanging thin DCF dry-bags on the outside of my pack, but I&#39;m going to give it a go. In our collections of spares I have two extra dry-bags and also my larger pack in case this system proves too unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1553071292/IMG_1813.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached to the pack I&#39;ll also have two Zpacks waist strap pouches, a Mammut shoulder strap bottle holder and a Mammut shoulder strap accessory pouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of strapping the dry-bags to the sides of the pack is it limits the height of the water bottles I&#39;ll be able to carry in the side pockets. I&#39;ve chosen 1L Nalgene Ultralight HDPE wide-mouth bottles to best fit with this system, which isn&#39;t ideal because they&#39;re much heavier (108g) than the standard disposable bottles I&#39;d usually take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll also be bringing an Hyperlight Mountain Gear Stuff Pack, which I&#39;ll be able to attach to the back of my pack in case I need extra volume. The mountaineering sections I may need a bit more space. This is a handy little bag, which at only 117g makes an excellent day pack.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The food we&#39;ll be eating on the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hindsight I would have taken less camping food. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/&#34;&gt;Itinerary - Resupply&lt;/a&gt;
page for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will eat as much freshly prepared food as we can. Dal Bhat is delicious and we want to support the local economy as much as possible. However, we&#39;ll only have access to locally prepared food on about half the 115 days in the itinerary. The rest of the food we&#39;ll have to take with us. We would love to be able to resupply at shops along the route, but the remote villages rarely sell backpacking compatible food. It&#39;s not really possible to cook lentils and rice on a backpacking stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551710343/IMG_2289.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our logistics partner &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:mactrek@gmail.com&#34;&gt;Mactrek&lt;/a&gt; will be arranging several supply packages to be delivered to us at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/&#34;&gt;various points&lt;/a&gt; along the route, but we&#39;ll have to carry ten days of food at several points. Calorie density is essential, and ease of preparation is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;breakfast&#34;&gt;Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be having a fast-and-light breakfast of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rxbar.com/&#34;&gt;RxBar&lt;/a&gt;, 100g of trail mix and a hot coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lunch&#34;&gt;Lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch will be easy to prepare - no stove needed - 100g of &lt;a href=&#34;https://huel.com/&#34;&gt;Huel&lt;/a&gt; protein shake, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.theprobar.com/Products/PROBAR-Meal&#34;&gt;ProBar Meal&lt;/a&gt; energy bar, and half an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropanfbomb.com/collections/nut-butters&#34;&gt;FBOMB&lt;/a&gt; nut butter sachet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dinner&#34;&gt;Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner will be an &lt;a href=&#34;https://expeditionfoods.com/&#34;&gt;Expeditions Foods&lt;/a&gt; 1000 calorie dehydrated backpacking meal, and a hot chocolate drink. We&#39;ll add half an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropanfbomb.com/collections/fbomb-oils&#34;&gt;FBOMB&lt;/a&gt; oil sachet as a calorie boost. This should give us 2,912 calories per day for 612g.&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-apps/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The apps we&#39;ll be using to navigate on the trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. For my latest recommendation on navigation apps, see the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-navigational-sources-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What navigational sources would you recommend?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I&#39;ve not yet found an app that has all the features I need for navigating a long trek like the Great Himalaya Trail, so I&#39;ll be using these three apps in combination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;viewranger&#34;&gt;ViewRanger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;: Great maps. Ultimate flexibility - you can load lots of routes and adjust colours etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;: Downloading maps takes hours. Impossible to select waypoints that are close to routes - e.g. most of them. (I think this bug is fixed in the Android version). Rather complex UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4ZN62I38Yc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footpath&#34;&gt;Footpath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;: Beautiful simple UI, and beautiful maps. Route overview view with elevation profile graph.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;: All routes must me imported one by one. Offline maps must be downloaded separately for each route. Waypoints aren&#39;t supported at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzJZLKhTc58&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mapsme&#34;&gt;Maps.me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;: Maps for the whole of Nepal download very quickly. Waypoints may be selected easily. The app can route from point to point along footpaths even when offline, which is pretty amazing. Obviously the footpaths have to exist in the map database, which will not always be the case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;: Maps aren&#39;t topographic, so of limited use for off-trail navigation. Only imports KML files (not GPX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6rY1eoqASA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that ViewRanger and Footpath are not particularly efficient at loading multiple routes and downloading offline maps, so getting them set up was a major task taking several days. I&#39;ve been chatting to the developer of Footpath who is making some changes that might make this easier soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Navigation - Emergencies</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-emergencies/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;How I use my GPS watch for emergency navigation.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. Unfortunately due to a couple of problems, using my Garmin Fenix watch as an emergency navigation aid wasn&#39;t ideal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s a frustrating limitation of 1000 waypoints on the Garmin Fenix 5 watch. I can&#39;t find any way around is, so I had to reduce the km markers to one every 3km. This made the system less useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kept the watch in an accessible pocket on the outside of my pack, however this meant that the watch would accidentally get turned on, which ran the battery out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the watch home at one of the resupply points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carry a Garmin Fenix 5 GPS watch, which I use just for emergency navigation. Emergency navigation is for when there&#39;s zero visibility, no trail and adverse weather. The times when you don&#39;t want to be taking your phone out of your pocket every two minutes to check where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave the watch turned off, but easily accessible in an outside pocket so I can get it when needed. GPS watches don&#39;t have particular big screens so trying to use a topo map isn&#39;t the best idea. Even routes or tracks aren&#39;t easy to follow. My tried and tested emergency navigation procedure is to create a set of kilometer marker waypoints for the entire route, and load these onto the watch along with any other waypoints I have for the trek. You can find these markers for our GHT route &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-gps/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551695384/IMG_1754.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emergency navigation situation where I&#39;ve lost the trail, I&#39;ll first refer to my phone to work out where I am, and which waypoint I need to be heading towards. I&#39;ll then navigate to this waypoint on the Garmin. The waypoint list is ordered by proximity, so even with ~2000 waypoints the one you need will usually be near the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My navigation home screen is configured to show me the bearing to the waypoint, the distance and the vertical distance. Bearing is the most important. Attached to the watch strap I keep an analogue compass (Suunto M-9). This has a sighting window, allowing my to get an accurate direction to the given bearing. The velcro strap that comes with the compass is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method has worked in practise and got me out of a couple of tricky situations in the past. Once on top of the Pigne d&#39;Arolla, descending to Cabane Des Vignettes in low visibility. That descent is notoriously tricky, with cliffs on one side and a serac field on the other. Another time in Iceland in zero visibility and horizontal rain we decided to locate Fimmvörðuháls Mountain Hut using the Garmin. Both times it worked flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Navigation - Flashcards</title>

            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-flashcards/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;I created a set of daily flashcards for the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. After the trek I created a comprehensive set of trail notes that can be downloaded as a PDF
for printing. I would recommend using these instead of the flashcards detailed below, which were often rather out of
date. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/&#34;&gt;Trail Notes page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin&#39;s guide book is excellent, but not organised optimally for a thru-hike of the GHT. I created a set of flashcards, one for each day of our itinerary. They are intended to be printed on A5, double sided. Included in each page is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The description from Robin&#39;s guide book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional description from Himalaya Adventure Labs (marked with &lt;em&gt;HAL&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crop from the Himalaya Map House 1:150k raster map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stats from the GPX route including elevation range, min, max, total ascent and descent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An elevation profile graph for the day from GPSies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m intending to use these paper flashcards as our primary navigation for the simple sections, only referring to the GPS topo maps when we need to. Here&#39;s an example page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_1500,dpr_auto/v1550912095/example-999.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flashcards contain content from Robin&#39;s guide book and also the Himalaya Adventure Labs trail notes, so I can&#39;t distribute them freely as a download. I&#39;m happy to send you a copy if you get permission from both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greathimalayatrail.com/contactUs.php&#34;&gt;Robin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/contact-us/&#34;&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a set printed on waterproof 115gsm Xerox NeverTear paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colourgraphics.com/&#34;&gt;ColourGraphics&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&#39;t be happier with the results - they&#39;re perfect:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Navigation - GPS routes</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-gps/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-gps/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;How I created GPS routes for the entire trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. After the trek I updated and improved my GPX route files, and I would recommend using the
latest version as your primary navigation route. You can download the GPX files on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gps-routes/&#34;&gt;GPS routes page&lt;/a&gt;.
Also see the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-navigational-sources-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What navigational sources would you recommend?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViewRanger will provide topo maps of the entire trekking area, but these would be of limited use without the route highlighted. The GHT is infrequently trekked, so there&#39;s relatively few digital resources available. For the more popular ares, the ViewRanger topo maps often include footpaths - but for much of the trek there is nothing plotted on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve tried to bring all the available GPS resources together in this section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robin Boustead published a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greathimalayatrail.com/gps.php?cId=2&#34;&gt;collection of waypoints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Himalayan Adventure Labs also publish &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/great-himalaya-trail/interactive-map-great-himalayan-trail/&#34;&gt;a collection of waypoints&lt;/a&gt; which include some of (but not all of) Robin&#39;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seth Wolpin and Doc McKerr both recorded tracks of their thru-hikes, which Himalayan Adventure Labs merged into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/great-himalaya-trail/interactive-map-great-himalayan-trail/&#34;&gt;set of tracks&lt;/a&gt; with excellent notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth&#39;s track is a great resource, but some sections deviate significantly from our intended route. Robin&#39;s waypoints follow our route, but aren&#39;t connected with a track. I wanted a better option covering the whole route and following the Himalaya Map House paper maps. I also wanted each day of our itinerary to be a separate route segment. Finally I wanted each segment to match up with our paper flashcards (see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-flashcards/&#34;&gt;Navigation - Flashcards&lt;/a&gt; article), so I could extract the stats and elevation profile. To create this I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gpsies.com/&#34; title=&#34;www.gpsies.com&#34;&gt;gpsies.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is an invaluable online service. A GPX route can be created by simply drawing points onto the map. A handy time-saver is the GraphHopper feature, which automatically adds a section of route by following footpaths. Not all the footpaths found on the topo maps have routable paths, but most do. Where footpaths weren&#39;t drawn on the map I&#39;ve estimated the position of the trail from the 1:150k scale Himalaya Map House paper maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_1000,dpr_auto/v1550946659/Screenshot%202019-02-23%20at%2009.29.48.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While creating the flashcards I created 115 separate GPX files in this way, then merged them into a single GPX file containing 115 route segments. It should be noted that this route is only as accurate as the highlighted route on the paper maps, which will not be 100% perfect. However, most of it matches up almost perfectly with Seth&#39;s recorded track, so I&#39;m optimistic that it&#39;s a good enough estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also merged and de-duplicated the waypoint databases from Robin and Himalayan Adventure Labs, and normalised the formatting of the names. I created a set of km markers for each day, which are useful for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-emergencies/&#34;&gt;emergency navigation&lt;/a&gt;, and assigned each waypoint to the nearest marker to generate a unique code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the final files here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routes - All 115 daily routes merged into a single file in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/s5p5neji22fi0bu/routes.gpx?dl=1&#34;&gt;GPX&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/g25xzr6rs4omm4o/routes.kml?dl=1&#34;&gt;KML&lt;/a&gt; format. If you need the routes as 115 individual GPX files, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6giufmdi3pq9y1/routes.zip?dl=1&#34;&gt;here&#39;s a zip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markers - All 1432 km markers in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/mk0kvn48uk2lva1/markers.gpx?dl=1&#34;&gt;GPX&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/vfa60081uswczuo/markers.kml?dl=1&#34;&gt;KML&lt;/a&gt; format. I&#39;ve found a frustrating limitation of 1000 waypoints on the Garmin Fenix 5 watch. I can&#39;t find any way around is, so I&#39;ve created a set of km markers containing only one in 3 markers. So each day has a marker at 0km, 3km, 6km etc. This gives 516 markers, added to the 475 waypoints gives 991 in total. You can find the reduced marker file in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8jgxplw9d2uo2q/markers-every-3-km.gpx?dl=1&#34;&gt;GPX format here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waypoints - A file containing all 475 waypoints in GPX and KML format can be found in the Himalayan Adventure Labs file repository, which is linked on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/great-himalaya-trail/interactive-map-great-himalayan-trail/&#34;&gt;Interactive Map page&lt;/a&gt;. Look for the &lt;em&gt;Dave Brophy&#39;s files&lt;/em&gt; directory, and the files are called &lt;em&gt;waypoints.gpx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;waypoints.kml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracks - A single file containing the 10 Himalayan Adventure Labs tracks in GPX and KML formats can be found in their file repository, which is linked on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/great-himalaya-trail/interactive-map-great-himalayan-trail/&#34;&gt;Interactive Map page&lt;/a&gt;. Look for the &lt;em&gt;Dave Brophy&#39;s files&lt;/em&gt; directory, and the files are called &lt;em&gt;himalayan-adventure-labs-tracks.gpx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;himalayan-adventure-labs-tracks.kml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to know how I manipulated the GPX files, here&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dave/gpx/blob/master/main.go&#34;&gt;the source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a demo of how to load KML routes into Google Earth, which gives an excellent 3D visualisation:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Navigation - Methods</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-methods/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-methods/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The navigation methods and resources we&#39;ll be using on the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. For my latest recommendation on navigation methods, see the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-navigational-sources-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What navigational sources would you recommend?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating with the aid of digital topo maps is a game changer for unsupported trekking. However, extreme care must be taken because digital devices often fail in the field. We will be using several backups to mitigate this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My iPhone with topo mapping, offline maps and GPX route (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-apps/&#34;&gt;Navigation - Apps&lt;/a&gt; article).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathilde&#39;s phone with similar setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup iPod touch with similar setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garmin Fenix 5 GPS watch with waypoints and analogue compass (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-emergencies/&#34;&gt;Navigation - Emergencies&lt;/a&gt; article).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup 13,000mAh battery with 21W solar panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily flashcards for the intended route with map snapshots, descriptions and elevation profile (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-flashcards/&#34;&gt;Navigation - Flashcards&lt;/a&gt; article).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Himalaya Map House paper maps - 1:150k covering a wide area with alternate routes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll use the paper flashcards to get an overview of the day, and as primary navigation on simple days. As the route gets more tricky we&#39;ll fall back on our phones, running the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-apps/&#34;&gt;various topo mapping apps&lt;/a&gt; with offline maps. I have an old iPod touch which has also been configured with these apps for another backup. For &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-emergencies/&#34;&gt;emergency navigation&lt;/a&gt; in bad conditions we&#39;ll use my Garmin Fenix GPS watch with an analogue compass. Finally as a paper backup we&#39;ll be carrying the Himalaya Map House paper maps which cover the entire trekking region with many other alternate trails marked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spent considerable time planning the ideal route along the GHT High Route. This will undoubtedly change as the trek progresses&amp;hellip; However the alternate trails will lead south towards lower elevations which usually have more population and services&amp;hellip; so the navigation should get easier as we deviate from the High Route.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Itinerary - Resupply</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2019 12:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>dave</author>
            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Resupply locations and food tracking calculations.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. Prior to the trek we had no idea where we would be able to resupply with food that could be
prepared with a backpacking stove, so we assumed we would never resupply along the trek. This meant we were carrying
far too much food for much of the trek. See the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#when-can-you-resupply-with-camping-food-along-the-route&#34;&gt;When can you resupply with camping food along the route&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14x_OJ4mJNoHuj1LnYnyGULdE3P9kG6CwOdY1t0sv_H8/edit&#34;&gt;trail notes Google sheet&lt;/a&gt;,
and the &amp;ldquo;Lodge&amp;rdquo; column - most of the villages with &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; (guesthouse) in this column should be able to sell you noodles.
With this information, I believe we could have significantly reduced the amount of food we would need to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our general food strategy is to eat freshly cooked local food wherever possible, and not to reply on buying unprepared food along the trail that we cook later. Remote villages often will have nothing to sell apart from perhaps rice, flour and lentils - not exactly calorie dense or backpacking stove compatible. In order to ensure we have enough food between resupply points, I&#39;ve attempted to estimate where we&#39;ll be able to eat local food. When we&#39;re eating local food we&#39;re not using our rations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our resupply points were picked by juggling a few variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy is it for our logistical assistance to get to the resupply point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far from the last resupply point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much we want to resupply with at the previous resupply point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many days of food we want as a safety margin for this section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table below, we show some extra columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resupply: the days we will receive resupply packages - the number indicates the days rations we&#39;ll have at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food: The fraction of a days rations we&#39;ll be able to save by eating locally purchased food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rations: The number of days rations left at the end of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tableizer-container&#34;&gt;&lt;table class=&#34;tableizer-table&#34;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class=&#34;tableizer-firstrow&#34;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Day&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Location&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Resupply&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Rations&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Phurumbu&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chiruwa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;66%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sukethum&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Amjilosa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gyabla&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ghunsa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;66%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;21/04&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Khangpachen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The intended itinerary for the trek.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/&#34;&gt;Trail Notes&lt;/a&gt; page or &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14x_OJ4mJNoHuj1LnYnyGULdE3P9kG6CwOdY1t0sv_H8/edit&#34;&gt;this Google sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the updated itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any trek it&#39;s important to get an idea of the approximate itinerary. Of course, on a long trek like this the exact route will need to be flexible, but I&#39;ll plan the intended route and the maps and guide book will provide alternates when we need them. The alternates are almost certainly going to take us south and down hill where services and accommodation are more usually more plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several companies that trek the Great Himalaya Trail fully supported&amp;hellip; these operations take a handful of customers accompanied by an army of guides and porters. Some of them conveniently publish their daily itinerary, and this made a great start in my planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This route was easily cross referenced with Robin&#39;s guide book - obviously a large group always moves at the speed of the slowest member, so the fully supported itineraries moved quite a bit slower than we are hoping to. The guidebook gave us more realistic hiking times, along with various other sources I found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve intentionally added rest days only when essential. I&#39;m expecting to take more than shown here, so the date should be interpreted as the earliest we could possible arrive somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;tableizer-container&#34;&gt;&lt;table class=&#34;tableizer-table&#34;&gt;

            <title>Great Himalaya Trail - Navigation - Sources</title>

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/navigation-sources/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The maps, guide books and navigation sources available for the GHT.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is out of date. For my latest recommendation on navigation sources, see the FAQ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-navigational-sources-would-you-recommend&#34;&gt;What navigational sources would you recommend?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigation is critical for any expedition, and especially those venturing into remote areas where the trail network is more tenuous. You&#39;ll realise I&#39;m a great believer in technology - however I&#39;d like to point out from the outset that a paper map backup is always required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I&#39;m going to go through some of the sources that are available for navigating the the 1300km Great Himalaya Trail. This posed my biggest navigation challenge to date. The distances are vast and the trails are often not even marked on the most detailed maps available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guide-book&#34;&gt;Guide book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update-1&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide book was occasionally useful, but the detailed descriptions were often rather out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide book from Robin Boustead is the best source I&#39;ve found about the GHT. Robin essentially invented the Great Himalaya Trail, and pioneered the route which links up more established trails with the more remote areas and high mountain passes. The guide book has a detailed itinerary and descriptions for each day. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1905864604&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s a link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551706673/5026693-NOC02-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;himalayan-adventure-labs&#34;&gt;Himalayan Adventure Labs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update-2&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan Adventure Labs GPS tracks were useful to compare with other routes, however probably less so now I&#39;ve
published updated and improved GPX routes. I would recommend using my latest GPX routes as your primary navigation
route. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/&#34;&gt;Trail Notes&lt;/a&gt; page for the latest GPX files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Wolpin and friends over at Himalayan Adventure Labs have some great GPX files, notes and tips from their 2014 trek. You can find them at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.himalayanadventurelabs.com/great-himalaya-trail/interactive-map-great-himalayan-trail/&#34;&gt;www.himalayanadventurelabs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update-3&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himalaya Map House topo maps are excellent and you should definitely buy these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These excellent maps are co-produced with Robin, and include the GHT route as well as many other hiking trails. One caveat is the maps are 1:150k scale, so not exactly ideal for detailed navigation. Paper and digital versions are available from Robin&#39;s site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greathimalayatrail.com/&#34;&gt;www.greathimalayatrail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Be aware the paper versions are shipped from Nepal so will take a couple of weeks to arrive. The digital version is split into 12 jpg files, each is approx 10k x 6k resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_1200,dpr_auto/v1549882055/Screenshot%202019-02-11%20at%2011.20.21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finaid-maps&#34;&gt;FinAid maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;card&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-trail-update-4&#34;&gt;Post trail update&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t use the FinAid maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most detailed topographic maps of Nepal were produced in 1996 from aerial photography in collaboration with the government of Finland. The north of the country is covered by 1:50k scale maps, and the accuracy of the topographic features is excellent. However, the quality of the other information - trails, place names is sometimes less than ideal. In addition, the maps aren&#39;t based on the modern WGS84 geographic reference system, so can&#39;t be easily geo-coded for display in a GPS app. Paper copies of the maps can be purchased in Kathmandu (from Maps of Nepal in New Baneshwor, near the Everest Hotel). Digital copies of the maps are available for &lt;a href=&#34;https://jemecasseausoleil.blogspot.com/2017/07/cartes-du-nepal.html&#34;&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;. A set covering the GHT route totals about 120 jpg files, approx 8k x 7k resolution - over 1GB in total. If anyone has any good ideas on how these digital maps could be best presented in a mobile app, I would love to get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/what-is-the-great-himalaya-trail/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;A brief overview of the 1,300km trail we&#39;ll be hiking this summer.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_1600,dpr_auto/v1550183229/overview-map-5000.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Great Himalaya Trail is the combination of several trail networks stretching the length of the Himalaya range, with sections in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. Our trek will follow the High Route of the Nepal section from Kanchenjunga on the Indian border in the East to Hilsa on the Chinese border in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the high route is that it follows the highest feasible continuous route across the country, averaging 3,750m (12,000ft) of elevation, with passes taking us over 6,100m (20,000ft). In total 1,340km (830 miles) over 115 days of hiking, with 94,000m (310,000ft) of ascent and 93,000m (305,000ft) of descent - that&#39;s an average elevation change of 1,600m (5,250ft) per day. Including rest days, we&#39;re expecting to complete the trek in around 130 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the route passes through the more popular trekking areas of Everest and Annapurna, many sections visit some of the most remote corners of Nepal. For more than half the days, we&#39;re expecting to be camping and cooking our own food. We hope to complete the trek with the minimum of support, so no guides or porters hiking with us unless absolutely necessary for safety or mandated by local law. We will employ the services of a logistical assistance company based in Kathmandu, who will arrange several resupply drops to replenish our food and consumables that aren&#39;t readily available on the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be starting the trek in early April, with Mathilde joining a few weeks later near Makalu Base Camp. If you&#39;d like to follow along, check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/&#34;&gt;tracking map&lt;/a&gt; which will track our progress in real-time, or our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/updates/&#34;&gt;updates page&lt;/a&gt; where we&#39;ll be posting short messages regularly via satellite from the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our hike concludes, back at Champex.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail wound on, up into the hills once again for the last leg. To Trient, then down into the valley where we returned to the beautiful Lac Champex. This ends a magnificent 21 day hike from Zermatt to Chamonix and all the way round Mont Blanc. I&#39;ve seen beautiful mountains all over the world, but nothing beats the European Alps for charm.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-7-les-houches-chamonix/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;We continue through Les Houches, Chamonix and on to Argentiere.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see Les Houches and Chamonix in the distance for the long descent from the mountains. We had to make up a day so we bypassed the normal hiking trail along the Petit Balcon Sud, and walked through the centre of Chamonix. I&#39;ve lived here for four winters but this was my first time visiting in the  summer.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Summer Haute Route - Part 6: Refuge Des Mottets, Les Contamines</title>
            <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-6-mottets-contamines/</link>

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-6-mottets-contamines/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Over the Col de la Seigne and into France towards Les Contamines.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The valley to the west of Courmayeur gets plusher and wetter the further we go. Lush green marsh land and cattle grazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551035074/IMG_4720.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We leave the bog behind and head up the mountain to the Col de la Seigne, and to the France border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551035271/IMG_4729.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a long and steep descent to the stoutly constructed Refuge de la Mottets. One of the more comfortable mountain huts we&#39;ve visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551035465/IMG_4738.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we&#39;re hiking into easier terrain, and we soon reach the village of Les Contamines-Montjoie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551035565/IMG_4732%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Summer Haute Route - Part 5: La Fouly, Courmayeur</title>

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-5-la-fouly-courmayeur/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Over the pass to Italy and down the valley to Courmayeur.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onwards and upwards into the foothills of Mont Blanc from Lac Champex towards Italy. La Fouly is a cute little town with an amazing view, and I&#39;d highly recommend staying at the excellent Maya Joie hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549729130/IMG_4609%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we climbed further into the hills, the buildings became less frequent and the landscape more barren. The view down the valley towards Courmayeur from the Swiss Itallian border was one of the best of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549729285/IMG_4681%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refugio Bonetti is always a pleasure to stay at, winter or summer and this time it didn&#39;t disappoint. The Mont Blanc massive growing larger as we make our way down the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549729460/IMG_4713.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-4-verbier-champex/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Onwards down to La Chable and Champex.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most beautiful town in the European Alps, Verbier overlooks the most picturesque valley. After the last few days of rocks, scrambling and mountains, this all seems rather civilised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549728184/IMG_4576.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a day hiking along the valley floor, again I&#39;m ascending into the hills towards Lac Champex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549728519/IMG_4587.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this doesn&#39;t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/summer-haute-route-2018/part-3-dix-prafleuri/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Over the Pas de Chèvres, Mont Blanc de Cheilon, La Cabane des Dix&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next section led deep into the mountains. Up the valley to the ski resort of Arolla, and over the Pas de Chèvres to the imposing view of the Mont Blanc de Cheilon with La Cabane des Dix overlooking. I&#39;ve visited the Dix hut several times on the winter version of this route, so I pushed on towards the Pas du Chat and the Lac Dix beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549644809/IMG_4490.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabane de Prafleuri isn&#39;t in the most picturesque setting - crouching in the barren quarry carved out of the landscape during the construction of the Dix dam. I was running low on water for the last couple of hours hiking, so arriving at the cabin was very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549727659/IMG_4516.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey onwards to Mont Fort was perhaps the most perilous of the trip - an intense scramble up and over the Col de la Chaux. Very happy to arrive at Cabane du Mont Fort in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549728032/IMG_4548.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Lac de Moiry and the Cabane du Moiry&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549633470/IMG_4374.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike over the mountains to Gruben was a long way, but well worth the effort. The next day came a long traverse past the Lac de Moiry and up to the snout of the Moiry Glacier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549643721/IMG_4416.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glacier was spectacular, and the cabin was the most amazing place, perched on the side of the mountain overlooking the river of ice.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The first part of my journey from Zermatt along the Europaweg trail.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549618595/IMG_4255.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hiked the Haute Route in the opposite direction to most people, starting in Zermatt under the majestic Matterhorn and heading down the valley towards Grächen along the Europaweg trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1549619435/IMG_4283.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the longest in the world, spanning almost 500m (1620ft). A recent landslide blocked the trail shortly after the bridge, forcing a re-route down into the valley to Randa.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Easy navigation but an utterly exhausting trail up the never ending hill to Ghorepani, and beautiful Poon Hill.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below 
		is Michelle&#39;s text and my photos. You can find her original article at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/annapurna-circuit-itinerary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annapurna Circuit Itinerary&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trek from Tatopani to Ghorepani is probably the easiest to navigate. There are signs pointing to Ghorepani at every single intersection and the path is usually made from hand laid stones, making it the obvious route to take. Some people told us it would take 8 hours while others said 5 hours. Honestly, we probably did it in closer to 7 hours without counting stops, but it was a very long and very hot day, so I’d plan for 8 hours at the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466601/IMG_2996.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in altitude is what makes this day so difficult. The good news is, most of the path is off the main road, so you are walking uphill constantly but through beautiful little towns with amazing views. Because of the altitude gain, we stopped at least three times for tea or lunch. The tea stops were in tiny towns at the tops of hills. The lunch break was in Shikha at the Moonlight Guest House. The food was really good, but the woman there didn’t want to make me dal baht because it was too much work, and we were the only tourists. After trekking so hard, it was what I was really craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466660/IMG_3012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in Ghorepani, we stopped at the first hotel which is a massive building compared to other places we’ve stayed. The Asha Hotel &amp;amp; Restaurant felt a little cold and uninviting after the teahouses. It’s a cement building which was still under construction when we arrived. What sold it to us was the incredible owner, a young Nepali woman, who spent a large chunk of time in London. She was amazingly cool and insanely sweet. Once we saw the rooms which had the comfiest beds and blankets, we were totally sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466695/IMG_3013%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned to continue on and even do another trek, but my hiking boots got destroyed after walking so far in them. I couldn’t fix them and there was nowhere to buy a new pair, so I had to leave the conservation area by walking to Ulleri the following day to get a Jeep.  Luckily, I met a group of four on route so we split the cost which came to 1400 rupees ($14) each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in Ghorepani, it’s worth doing the hour walk to see Poon Hill. With my sneakers ruined, and cloudy weather, we didn’t do the trek which had no views that morning.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;A dangerous rock slide hampered our progress on the trail to Tatopani, ane we were exhausted by the end.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said in the previous paragraph, we made the bright decision to do two days of trekking in one. We were still in good spirits when leaving Ghasa. We attempted to take a side trek to the left. After walking pretty far down, we realized that a crane doing roadwork above had pushed giant boulders down the slope, and they had all landed on the footpath that cut across. There are no signs indicating this blockage, and the path is covered by what looks like a landslide. It’s a complete mess and very dangerous, so don’t take this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466482/IMG_2980.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past the construction work on the road is a well-marked path that has not been effected by roadwork. Be sure to take this one. It goes directly across a suspension bridge to the other side of the river. The path hugs along the cliffs, offering beautiful views. It goes through quaint villages with little tourism. At first there isn’t much elevation change but eventually the path does go up and down a couple of steep stairs. If you do this in two days, it shouldn’t be too exhausting, but we had been trekking for over 5 hours and were pretty tired at this point. After the hills, you’ll walk through fields of corn and pathways lined with marijuana plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466515/IMG_2983.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we did this section during the afternoon, we decided to stop in Dana for dinner. Getting here took 3.5 hours (with a few unplanned detours). We had giant plates of dal baht at the Asha Lodge and Restaurant. The food was great, and we consider staying, but were only an hour away from Tatopani if we walked on the road. We decided to skip the trail to save ourselves time, and to ensure we arrived at Tatopani before it got dark. We checked into the Hotel Trekkers Inn after finding out that the WiFi worked and there was hot water. The food is great and the staff are super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Tricky navigation and real coffee on the road to Ghasa.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day starts off on the road, but our GPS directs us across a footpath on the river. After getting halfway across the large expanse, we realize we are unable to pass and have to walk all the way back and around on the road. I would ask the locals if the foot path is there before trying the shortcut. It seemed the small bridges had been washed away. We stopped for tea at Kokhethanti at the only guesthouse in town. After tea, we continued over the bridge to the woods on the other side. It’s an insanely beautiful walk through cute little towns that offer amazing views of Annapurna I. It was the first time we’d seen that peak in the entire trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466291/IMG_2952.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk is beautiful and peaceful and not too long. Upon entering Kalopani, we see a sign for real coffee, and I pretty much sprinted to the haven known as the Annapurna Guest House. It was one of the fanciest places we’d seen. The off season price was $15 a room, but it’s pretty fancy compared to the teahouses in town. We sat down for a break to have real coffee, WiFi, and an early lunch. The shakshuka was delicious despite not having a lot of tomato sauce. It only took us two hours to get here, so we decided to continue on despite the lovely lodging option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466321/IMG_2966.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kalopani, there is a path to the left which you’ll want to take. We ended up missing it but were desperate to get off the road. In turn, we had to climb through some thorn bushes, over stone walls, and across someone’s field to get back on the footpath. Once there, it was totally worth the crazy detour. We stumble upon a goat herder with hundreds of goats all taking a nap in the shade of the pine trees. This path connected back with the main road. On the other side of the road, a path picks back up, but we missed it and ended up on the road for at least an hour in the intense sun and grueling heat until we reached Ghasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghasa is a tiny town which seems to have some construction going on on the walkways. We stopped in the Golden Inn Guest House for a pancake and tea. We did not stay in Ghasa because we had the brilliant idea to get all the way to Tatopani, which is 31km (20 miles) from Larjung. I do not recommend this. It was an insane day, and we didn’t arrive till 8pm. Most people stay in Ghasa, so I’ve split this up into two days for the sake of other people’s feet and sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;We battled gale force winds in the afternoon making our way to Larjung.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below 
		is Michelle&#39;s text and my photos. You can find her original article at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/annapurna-circuit-itinerary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annapurna Circuit Itinerary&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend leaving Marpha at 7:00am to avoid the intense afternoon winds. After walking through town, you can cross over the bridge to get off the main road and onto the trekking trail. That path goes through beautiful apple orchards that reminded me of upstate New York in the fall. On the way, we went by the Tibetan Refugee Camp where many of the shop owners told me they lived. A bit past that is a military base. We walk right through it, following the circuit trail. It’s one of the coolest yet most bizarre things I’ve seen on the trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465992/IMG_2915.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the military camp, the forest opens up into the river bed. It’s hard to see signs from here, and there are several different paths across the open space. If you look closely enough, you’ll see the red and white markers. It feels a bit like playing a game of Where’s Waldo. When you reach the other side, stay to the left near the small village and apple trees. There’s a path that cuts through. After the adorable little town, there’s another opening where you have to keep an eye out for the path again. It eventually leads to a path with a 250m (820 foot) incline, but beautiful views of Dhaulagiri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466045/IMG_2940.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After descending back down to the river, we stopped in Saura for a cup of tea at the only teahouse in town. The owner directed us across the river to Larjung. There are small wooden beams positioned across the areas that are harder to walk through, so we got across the river easily without having to walk out of the way to the next suspension bridge. This river bed used to be a sea and the entire area was underwater before tectonic plates moved. The cool thing about this, is there are fossils of sea creatures in the area which are millions of years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551466109/IMG_2951.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larjung is a small town. Honestly, it’s one of my least favorite places we’ve stayed. It’s the only place I’ve been where we said “Namaste” to people on the street and they didn’t reply. That being said, our teahouse owner was lovely and made incredible food. The place felt cozy even though we were the only ones there. Our original plan was to hire a local guide for the next day for 1500 rupees ($15) to see the Dhaulagiri Icefall. Unfortunately, road work caused a blockage on the path that even a guide wasn’t willing to attempt going over. We skipped the side trek the next morning, and without the side trek there’s really not much reason to stay here. I’d recommend going to Kalopani if you don’t plan to do this trek or if it’s not accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally planned to walk to Jomsom, but upon arriving, opted to keep moving on to Marpha. The road from Kagbeni to Jomsom is a dusty construction zone mess that crosses an empty river bed. It wasn’t especially scenic, and it was insanely windy, which I hear is common in this section of the trek. The side route that we didn’t take went up in elevation quite a bit, and I was still sore from coming down from the pass, so I wanted an easy day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465845/IMG_2880.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jomsom is a large village with very little charm. We had intended to spend two nights there to rest, but it lacked any personality. We made a stop at the ATM because we were all desperate for cash, grabbed lunch, and quickly exited the town which felt cold and distant compared to beautiful Kagbeni. The road to Marpha was much of the same. We walked through gravel and dust along the road until we entered the city gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465921/IMG_2902.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marpha is full of old world charm and beautiful quaint tea houses. After checking out a few, we ended up at Tanpopo. The rooms have ensuite bathrooms with hot showers and western toilets. The WiFi works better than any other place on the trek. The food is amazing (but a little spicy). Overall, the ambience sold us with its beautiful views and common areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re ending your trek here, you can exchange extra clothes for beautiful souvenirs made by Tibetan refugees in town.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Kagbeni is a beautiful town, lush green fields against a desert background.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine told me Kagbeni was a beautiful “sleepy town” that I should definitely go see. Most of the trekking route has been catered to tourism, and I was curious to see a town that hadn’t been completely formed around the tourist trail. Since it was halfway to Jomsom, it seemed like an obvious choice to go visit. Plus, there were rumors of a YacDonald’s which was worth walking out of the way for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465510/IMG_2839.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily hop in a Jeep, but I’m cheap and had already walked this far, so it seemed dumb to give up at this point. I decided to follow the paved road for an easy day of walking after such a long trek the previous day. My trekking buddy opted for the “trail” on the opposite side of the valley which ended up being a dirt road. The paved road did have some detours that went through the small towns of Jharkot and Khingar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465571/IMG_2829.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views were incredible and unlike anything I’d seen in Nepal so far. Parts looked like the Grand Canyon while other sections looked like a desert. Make sure you have a lot of water because I was directly in the sun for three of the hours walking on pavement. The last hour of the trek we were both hammered with wind and small sandstorms. It was so strong that it almost knocked me over, and I was walking like a drunk. Make sure to have a face mask or buff with you to prevent getting dust in your mouth and nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465614/IMG_2865.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving in Kagbeni, I searched for the rest of my crew and strolled through the beautiful streets. It’s the oldest city I’ve seen in Nepal, and the architecture is incredible. I’d stumble on stupas, rows of prayer wheels, and old stone buildings. I eventually decided to eat and stay at YacDonalds despite the $5 room charge. I ordered the happy meal for lunch which promised a side of happiness and they were right. It was an AMAZING burger even by American standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465764/IMG_2870.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The highest point of the trek at 5,400m and we&#39;re all feeling the altitude.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below 
		is Michelle&#39;s text and my photos. You can find her original article at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/annapurna-circuit-itinerary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annapurna Circuit Itinerary&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pre ordered our breakfast the night before which included honey porridge at 4:00am and two hard boiled eggs to go. After packing and getting dressed, we ended up starting the hike at 5:00am. The route to High Camp is steep and takes about an hour. There is only one hotel at High Camp, so we stopped there to have a hot tea and change our clothes (I was hot). We spent about a half hour there before heading back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465029/IMG_2768.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part right after high camp was my favorite. The sky was still somewhat clear of clouds and we could see several beautiful peaks to the right of the path that were breathtaking. The path from here to the pass varied from flat sections to short steep sections. Looking at it from afar, it looked like the easiest walk ever, but the altitude made us feel extremely out of breath. We all looked like we had been weighted down at the feet. After about 2 hours we reached Thorung La Pass which is a building with a bunch of prayer flags next to it. Unfortunately, clouds had rolled in, and it started to snow, so we couldn’t see any views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465259/IMG_2794%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hugging everyone and eating some celebratory yak cheese, we began the very steep descent to Muktinath. It’s a 1700m (5,577 foot) descent which was rough on my knees and made me feel like an old grandma. The views were incredible, but it took all of us longer than we expected to get back down. We stopped at Chambar Bhu along the way and had a long lunch as our group all caught up with each other. We rested for about 2 hours, and then finished the gradual descent back down to Muktinath and arrived around 2:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465305/IMG_2817.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before, we all decided to meet at the Bob Marley Hotel. When we arrived, we all celebrated with food, drinks, and a few games of pool. The atmosphere there is really nice with great music playing. The food was amazing, and I highly recommend the margherita pizza and apple pie. The hot showers were amazing, and my room was comfortable. The only downfall was that the WiFi didn’t work great. Otherwise, I probably would have stayed longer. A lot of people end their trek here and take a jeep or bus to Jomsom or Pokhara. We decided to continue on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465386/IMG_2828.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The trail starts getting really tough as the elevation increases towards the pass.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yak Kharka literally means yak shed, so you’ll see a ton of yaks being herded to the fields beyond the town. On the way to Ledar we passed all the herders heading out in the morning in what felt like the most authentic part of the trek. The hike was easy and takes less than an hour with a gradual incline up 150m (492 feet). To the right is an incredible view of Chulu West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551464817/IMG_2751.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ledar, the path evens out for a while. When it splits, stay to the left heading towards the river and again take the path to the left at the second fork towards the suspension bridge. We took the path to the right which goes all the way down to the river and back up a steep incline, making it a harder route even though it ends up in the same place. At the top is an adorable little tea house. The lady inside and her fat little dog are amazing. She advised us to be careful ahead because there was a landslide zone and blue sheep walk along the ridge knocking down loose stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551464874/IMG_2765.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the land slide, we do see blue sheep running along the ridge and grazing in the grass. I wait for them all to pass before proceeding to ensure that no rocks fall down. This area has a pretty wide path compared to other areas on the trail, so it’s not as scary as the Tilicho Lake side trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551464760/IMG_2775.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Yak Kharka, it started to snow. We had originally planned to try to make it to High Camp, but I had a small headache so we decided to stay lower to acclimate. I heard the one hour from Yak Kharka made going over the pass harder. Half of our group went to High Camp and half stayed behind. Friends told me High Camp was freezing cold, the facilities weren’t great, and they didn’t sleep at altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551465186/IMG_2772.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we stayed at the Thorong Base Camp Lodge where we had people playing guitar, dancing, doing yoga, playing high altitude chess, and a Jenga competition that took hours to complete and got insanely intense. We had to walk further in the morning, but we had an incredible time staying in a warm lodge with fun games to keep us busy. It was one of my favorite nights of the trek, so I highly recommend stopping in Thorung Phedi.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;My favourite evening of the whole trek in Yak Kharka, as snow starts falling.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.

	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To leave Manang, you’ll need to pass an ACAP check post to show your permits. After that, follow the main path and the signs pointing to Thorung La until you are out of the village. Once you leave, you’ll see the road split and the sign will point you to the right. The trail is easy to follow and looks more like a road. It has a gradual incline all the way to Gunsang where we stopped to have a cup of tea at the Chullu West Hotel on the left. From here you can see Ganggapurna. It took us about an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551464539/IMG_2740.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ganggapurna, it’s an easy and beautiful trek to Yak Kharka. We honestly could have continued onto the next town which is close by, but we fell in love with the teahouse we choose to have lunch at. The Ganggapurna Hotel has the cutest little dining area at the front and it has good WiFi, gas showers, and electricity (while the rest of the town’s power was out.) We got the room and WiFi for free in exchange for eating lots of food there. Hot showers were $2, but I heard they weren’t that great so I skipped one.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a day in Braka to acclimate. The best way to acclimate is to walk high and sleep low. There are two popular side treks that start in Braka. Ice Lake goes up to 4,600m and offers spectacular views, but I’ve heard that the lake itself is nothing special. We decided to do Milarepa’s Cave which is at 4,250m. The cave was extremely hard to find and marked incorrectly on maps, so we ended up seeing two other “caves” instead. That being said, it offers incredible views in almost every direction. You can check out this post on Milarepa’s Cave for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our friends walked to Manang (an extra 40 mins) in the afternoon. I would recommend doing this because Manang has a lot to offer as far as food and comfort. There’s even a small movie theater where I would recommend seeing the movie Caravan (a Nepali favorite). I also recommend stocking up on yak cheese or any trekking items you might need before going over the pass. After a side trek to Tilicho, we went through Manang and stayed at Hotel Yeti which had a bakery, gas shower, clean rooms, and good food.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;An amazing day hiking to Pisang as we start to get glimpses of the Annapurna range.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;

		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guesthouse owner directed us toward the path to Manang. It starts out nice and gentle with beautiful views of the mountains to the left. The path remains almost flat for an hour and then you hit a steep incline. Make sure to stay on the trekking trail (by crossing the suspension bridge) and not the road. The trail is steeper but the road is much longer. At the top of the hill is a small tea shop which is the perfect place to stop and catch your breath. The owner is a sweet little old lady who has all kinds of goodies. Just another ten minutes up the road you’ll be greeted by a woman selling fresh apple pie for 100 rupees ($1) and amazingly delicious yak cheese! We sat there for an hour by the pagoda just enjoying the views with a group of other trekkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551006985/IMG_2529%20%282%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tea break, you’ll walk through the beautiful village of Ghyaru. Most of the homes are made out of stone and the small narrow alleyways are gorgeous. After leaving town, there’s a bit more uphill and then the trail evens out and it’s a beautiful walk to Ngawal. The Ngawal Mountain House is the perfect place for lunch. It has the cleanest kitchen I’ve seen trekking and one of the nicest bathrooms I’ve seen in Nepal. We debated staying here, but in the end decided to stick to our plan. The rooms here are between $5 and $25 a night, but look very posh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551463363/IMG_2519.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Ngawal, it’s a gentle incline along the road with just a few hills. We decided to take the easier route on the map (to the left) since the morning was so exhausting. You’ll pass through a few small villages and then arrive in beautiful Braka. We stayed at the very nice New Yak Hotel which is one of the first ones in town. We arrived late in the afternoon and since it’s off season, we managed to get the room for free. They have beautiful clean rooms and a very hot gas shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551463693/IMG_2600%20%281%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Spectacular scenery on the trail from Chame to Pisang.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving Chame, we followed the main road for about an hour and a half. Along the way we stumbled upon an apple farm with a small tea shop and an extravagant hotel. It was the most beautiful lodging I’d seen in all of Nepal. The Farmhouse looked like it was straight out of Upstate New York, and reminded me so much of home. The small shop out front had incredible fresh chocolate covered donuts and apple tea. If you want to break up the trek with a bit of luxury, the hotel costs $60 a night for a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551463071/IMG_2457.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tea we followed the road and took a path to the left which was a little bit steep, but not for long. It crossed through the main road and picked up immediately on the other side which had gorgeous pine tree forests. We decided to stop for an early lunch in Dhikur Pokhari at the Sworgadwari Rooftop Restaurant. It’s the first restaurant in town and has the best view of the steep sloping mountain range that you’ll see on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551463176/IMG_2485.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we followed signs for Upper Pisang but somehow missed the trail on the right. We ended up in Lower Pisang after following the main road which is rather dusty. We continued on the road to Upper Pisang and headed for the tea houses at the top. The views from the top are incredible and Annapurna 2 looked gorgeous in the distance. We chose to stay at the Tuniche and Rooftop Restaurant where there’s a gas shower and large clean rooms. The entire city was without power (temporarily) so no one has electricity or WiFi. At the top of Upper Pisang is a beautiful monastery where you can stop by and listen to monks chanting before dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Switchbacks and bridges as we pass Qunche and Danakyu towards Chame.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;

		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day starts out back on the main road with a nice gradual incline. There’s a fork in the road, and we took the one going to the right which goes over a bridge to the other side of the river. From there, there’s a steep switchback followed by a small path on the left with a sign for Chame. This section of the trek goes through beautiful corn fields and farm land. You can also see tons of marijuana plants growing like weeds along the pathway. The path descends back to the river and crosses over a bridge connecting with the main road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551461818/IMG_2438.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there you walk through the villages of Qunche and Danakyu. After you leave the rather large and brightly colored Danakyu, you can follow the main road until you see a path on the left. The path takes you up a steep incline and brings you out right in front of Tamang. We had lunch at the Tibet Lhasa Guest House which had great vegetable egg fried rice and fast WiFi. Tamang is located in a large open valley which has views from all sides. It took us about 3 hours to reach here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551461896/IMG_2442.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch, you get back on the main road which has a gentle incline, and follow it towards Chame. There’s a side path on the right with some small hills, but nothing really difficult. The path passes over a bridge and through several small towns and finally comes out in the large village of Thanchowk. You’ll end up back on the main road to Koto. Both towns are nice places to stop for tea. A bit further down the road and along the path to the right you’ll find Chame. It’s a large town with lots of places to buy last minute trekking supplies. We walked all the way to the end of town where there’s a suspension bridge. Just across the bridge and to the right is the New Tibet Hotel which has large rooms, very nice and very hot showers, and decent WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Our first day hiking completely off the road, all the way to Dharapani.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551461056/IMG_2423%20%282%29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first day completely off the main road. The walk to Tal is mostly uphill and some sections are a bit steep, making it a long morning. The pathway there goes through beautiful bamboo forests and cliffs covered in lush ferns. The endangered red panda is known to live in the area. Tal is a gorgeous town set between a river and a waterfall in a wide open valley. When we arrive, we walk to the end of town and stop at the Paradise Hotel &amp;amp; Restaurant for tea and the WiFi works great. It looks like it’s going to rain so we decide to get as close to Dharapani as we can before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551460744/IMG_2390.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk to Karte isn’t as steep and the weather clears up, so we stop for lunch at 3 Sisters Hotel and Restaurant. The food is good and gives us the energy to walk the remaining 30 minutes to Dharapani. Karte looks like a decent place to buy some toiletries and snacks that might not be available in Dharapani. The end of the route is easy and goes by quickly. We decide to stay at the Hayath Guest House which has gas showers, okay WiFi, and large rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;Fabulous Dal Baht and confusing side treks as we continue towards Chamje.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trek from Bahundana to Chamje starts off rather easy. There are some markers on the road to follow some side trails, but they lead out of the way and straight uphill. They don’t bypass anything and they don’t offer a view. These side routes end up adding almost an hour to our walk, and we end up hiking for 6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551460378/IMG_2408.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a gradual but very long uphill switchback on the road. It took about a half hour for us to complete it, and by the end, I felt exhausted, mostly from carrying my pack. We got hit with insanely hot weather and no matter how much water I drank; it didn’t seem to be enough. We grabbed lunch in Syange. Our original plan was to try to walk to Tal, but it seems too far, so we stop at Chamje for the night and stay at the Potala Hotel. The shower is hot, there’s a flushing toilet, and for dinner we have the best dal baht I’ve ever had while trekking.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;After a late start to avoid the rain, we again take the easier path and don&#39;t regret it.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk from Bhulbhule to Bahundanda takes about five hours. We got a late start due to rain in the morning, so we didn’t set out until 10:30am. Again, we stuck along the road. We both figured that we would have plenty of days of trekking up steep mountains, so we took it easy. There are a few small trails that cut through villages and bypass small chunks of roadway, so we took those. We passed through Ngadi which is a cute village, but we had such a late start that we decided to move on instead of stopping for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551460251/IMG_2383.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to Bahundanda gets a little bit steeper towards the end. There’s a small trail on the right leading up to the town which sits perched on the top of the hill. There’s music playing from the village and a large beautiful tree covered in prayer flags. We missed the small path because there were no signs, so we ended up taking the unnecessarily long route up the steep road which could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;h1&gt;The first part of our trek... We made the right decision in taking the easier path.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34;&gt;
	&lt;span class=&#34;image left&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;&#34;&gt;
		&lt;img class=&#34;image fit&#34; style=&#34;margin-bottom:0;&#34; src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_fill,g_auto/v1551473387/about-photo-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Michelle&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;p style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0.75rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;&#34;&gt;
		I hiked the Annapurna Circuit with Michelle from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Full Time Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. 
		She did a great write-up of our trek which she kindly let me borrow, so what you see below 
		is Michelle&#39;s text and my photos. You can find her original article at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fulltimeexplorer.com/annapurna-circuit-itinerary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annapurna Circuit Itinerary&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tourist buses from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar weren’t running when I went, so I took the local bus. It takes between 6 and 10 hours depending on your luck. Mine took about 7, so I recommend taking the earliest bus possible and having lunch in Besi Sahar. The local bus costs 360 rupees ($3.60), and it left from Gongabu New Bus Station Park. When the bus arrives in Besi Sahar you’ll want to take it to the very last stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you walk to the end of the main road in Besi Sahar, you’ll find the road goes downhill and to the right along the river. It seems there are several other routes, but for me, it was my first day carrying my own backpack. In the past, I’d always had a porter and carried a small day pack. Both David (my trekking buddy) and I agreed that it was unnecessary to make the first day harder than it had to be, so we decided to stick to the road instead of climbing a steep staircase on the trekking trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/wildernessprime/image/upload/w_800,dpr_auto/v1551459890/IMG_2337.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road runs along the river and still offers lovely views. We started our trek in mid-May when most trekkers are already completing the circuit. Therefore, there weren’t many jeeps on the road. We were also trekking closer to monsoon season which means rainfall would be more likely, but there was also very little dust. The hike was only three hours up a gentle incline. We wanted to stay in Khudi, but the only guesthouse there was full when we arrived, so we moved on to Bhulbhule where we stayed in the Heaven Guest House.&lt;/p&gt;
