      <description>Safety First a quick note about safety. The Great Himalaya Trail is a dangerous undertaking, with sections where one trip or wrong footstep can be fatal. Towards the end of our thru-hike we got in touch with a girl named Milena Piasecka from Poland. We gave her advice on various subjects as she planned here GHT, and she started just as we were finishing. A couple of months later, in the Everest region, she was tragically killed in a fall.</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2019 we spent five months hiking the Great Himalaya Trail across Nepal. Every day I made a vlog video of the trek. I&#39;ve finally got them ready to show the world. Here&#39;s the trailer - the vlog episodes start on February 1st. Feel free to subscribe / share. This has been a huge project over the past few months and I&#39;m super happy with the result!</description>

      <description>Post trail update See the Trail Notes page or this Google sheet for an updated description of this leg.
    5,308m, D061 - Navigation on the approach to Tilman&#39;s is reportedly rather difficult. It&#39;s less technical than the other passes and lower elevation at just 5,308m. A steep scramble beside an icefall is followed by an crevassed plateau, then a steep scramble down. The exit is a long walk along a glacier with a tricky river crossing at the end.</description>

      <description>Post trail update See the Trail Notes page or this Google sheet for an updated description of this leg.
    5,760m, D043 - The route over Tashi Labsta La is a rocky scramble with constant danger from rockfall and crevasses. We&#39;ll have to be very careful on this section, but it&#39;s perhaps less technical than the previous three passes.</description>

      <description>Post trail update See the Trail Notes page or this Google sheet for an updated description of this leg.
    5,845m, D031 - Amphu Labsta La is reportedly one of the most dangerous passes in Nepal, and certainly the most technical point on our trek. Climbing a steep icefall will require full climbing safety gear, and the descent is just as tricky with a 30m rappel.

      <description>Post trail update See the Trail Notes page or this Google sheet for an updated description of this leg.
    6,190m, D029 - The top of West Col is the highest point on the trek at 6,190m, but doesn&#39;t involve much climbing from the plateau. However a 200m rappel awaits on the other side. I&#39;ve read disconcerting reports about the state of the fixed ropes on this section, so extreme care will have to be taken.</description>

      <description>Post trail update See the Trail Notes page or this Google sheet for an updated description of this leg.
    6,180m, D028 - Sherpani &amp;amp; West Col are two impressive passes connected by a glaciated plateau. The ascent of Sherpani is a tough scramble followed by some easy rock climbing, followed by a 35m rappel down to the plateau. Rockfall from above and crevasses will be a constant danger.</description>

 The route has five passes that require moderate mountaineering skills and equipment. You can read more about the gear we&#39;ll be using on these sections on the Gear - Mountaineering page.
We&#39;ll be enlisting the services of a mountaineering guide to assist us over these five sections - Sherpani Col, West Col, Amphu Labsta La, Tashi Labsta La and Tilman&#39;s Pass.</description>

      <description>Post trail update We managed to ship all out trash back to Kathmandu, however the cost of shipping it out of the country was prohibitively expensive so we disposed of it in Kathmandu.
 As our backpacking food arrived I&#39;ve been getting more and more concerned about the amount of plastic trash we&#39;ll be generating. The remote regions of Nepal have very limited rubbish disposal facilities, and plastic trash is often dumped.</description>

 We&#39;ll be using a Garmin InReach Mini for communicating with the outside world during the trek. It uses the Iridium satellite network to allow two-way short message communication anywhere in the world, even when far away from a mobile network. It has several useful features:

      <guid>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/temperatures/</guid>
      <description>Post trail update These temperatures worked pretty well as a very rough estimate. See the FAQ: What&#39;s the temperature like?.
 It&#39;s possible to work out the approximate temperatures on the trail by taking the average monthly temperatures in Kathmandu at 1,400m, and using the adiabatic lapse rate of 9.8C per km. This gives us a very approximate estimate of the temperature we&#39;ll be experiencing on the trail.
The results show we&#39;ll be expecting a rather chilly -20C on some nights, but daytime temperatures rarely dip below freezing.</description>

      <description>Post trail update Our clothes worked pretty well throughout the trek.
 Clothes I&#39;ll take a single change of underwear and long-sleeve t-shirt - both Icebreaker merino wool. I&#39;ll take a pair of Darn Tough socks for the warmer sections and a warmer pair of Smartwool socks for the cold sections. The boots I&#39;ll be using aren&#39;t particularly warm so I&#39;ll need the extra insulation.
When it gets cold I&#39;ll be slipping into my Patagonia Capilene Air thermal layer, which is incredibly light for the warmth it provides.</description>

      <description>Post trail update We had major problems with solar panels. The Suntactics S5-Lite was underpowered and almost completely useless. We switched to using the 21W panels at one of the early resupply points, however these also caused problems. See the FAQ: Power.
Many of the water sources along the trek are silty and would clog a filter, so we switched to using chlorine tablets at the first resupply point and continued like this for the rest of the trek.</description>

      <description>Post trail update I hugely regret not taking my crampons and ice axe on the first section (from Kanchenjunga Base Camp to Makalu Base Camp). The first few high sections (Nango La, Lumbha Sumbha, Molun Pokhari) were all extremely dangerous without crampons.
Our mountaineering gear all worked extremely well, however I think we were lucky that our Petzl Leopard crampons lasted the whole trek. The Dyneema cord joining the front and back of the crampons together was badly worn from walking across rocks, and could have snapped at any time.</description>

      <description>Post trail update Our cooking system worked pretty well. One problem was that the Kovea Spider stove was tricky to keep alight with even the slightest wind, so I would probably swap for a more windproof stove if I was to do the trek again. It never got cold enough that we had to invert the canister.
 I&#39;ve chosen to take a canister stove - we&#39;ll be getting regular resupply packages that will replenish our gas supplies, so a heavy complex liquid fuel stove won&#39;t be needed.</description>

      <description>Post trail update Our sleep system worked extremely well. We used the Feathered Friends Snowbunting sleeping bags for the first sections, and as the temperature increased we swapped to the much lighter Zpacks bags. We didn&#39;t get much use out of the Evazote foam pads, so sent these hope at the first resupply point.
 I had initially intended to use my Zpacks 20F (-7C) sleeping bags, augmented with down jacket and pants.</description>

      <description>Post trail update We had a problem with the zip of our tent, but overall it performed well. The downside of a large tent like this is that it needs a lot of space to set up. There were several campsites where we needed to take extra time to scout out a sufficiently large spot to erect it.
 We&#39;ll be sleeping in a Hyperlite Mountain Gear Ultamid 4, which is a extremely sturdy four-season pyramid tent made of ultra light DCF fabric.</description>

 I&#39;ll be using the ZPacks Arc Blast. This is my third Arc Blast and without a doubt my favourite ever pack. The feather light 605g combined with the amazing load isolation is an unbeatable combination.</description>

      <description>Post trail update With hindsight I would have taken less camping food. See the Itinerary - Resupply page for more information.
 We will eat as much freshly prepared food as we can. Dal Bhat is delicious and we want to support the local economy as much as possible. However, we&#39;ll only have access to locally prepared food on about half the 115 days in the itinerary. The rest of the food we&#39;ll have to take with us.</description>

 Unfortunately I&#39;ve not yet found an app that has all the features I need for navigating a long trek like the Great Himalaya Trail, so I&#39;ll be using these three apps in combination:
ViewRanger Advantages: Great maps. Ultimate flexibility - you can load lots of routes and adjust colours etc.</description>

      <description>Post trail update This page is out of date. Unfortunately due to a couple of problems, using my Garmin Fenix watch as an emergency navigation aid wasn&#39;t ideal:
 There&#39;s a frustrating limitation of 1000 waypoints on the Garmin Fenix 5 watch. I can&#39;t find any way around is, so I had to reduce the km markers to one every 3km. This made the system less useful. I kept the watch in an accessible pocket on the outside of my pack, however this meant that the watch would accidentally get turned on, which ran the battery out.</description>

      <description>Post trail update This page is out of date. After the trek I created a comprehensive set of trail notes that can be downloaded as a PDF for printing. I would recommend using these instead of the flashcards detailed below, which were often rather out of date. See the Trail Notes page.
 Robin&#39;s guide book is excellent, but not organised optimally for a thru-hike of the GHT. I created a set of flashcards, one for each day of our itinerary.</description>

      <description>Post trail update This page is out of date. After the trek I updated and improved my GPX route files, and I would recommend using the latest version as your primary navigation route. You can download the GPX files on the Trail Notes page. Also see the FAQ: What navigational sources would you recommend?.
 ViewRanger will provide topo maps of the entire trekking area, but these would be of limited use without the route highlighted.</description>

      <description>Post trail update This page is out of date. For my latest recommendation on navigation methods, see the FAQ: What navigational sources would you recommend?.
 Navigating with the aid of digital topo maps is a game changer for unsupported trekking. However, extreme care must be taken because digital devices often fail in the field. We will be using several backups to mitigate this:
 My iPhone with topo mapping, offline maps and GPX route (see Navigation - Apps article).</description>

      <description>Post trail update This page is out of date. Prior to the trek we had no idea where we would be able to resupply with food that could be prepared with a backpacking stove, so we assumed we would never resupply along the trek. This meant we were carrying far too much food for much of the trek. See the FAQ: When can you resupply with camping food along the route.</description>

 In any trek it&#39;s important to get an idea of the approximate itinerary. Of course, on a long trek like this the exact route will need to be flexible, but I&#39;ll plan the intended route and the maps and guide book will provide alternates when we need them.</description>

 Navigation is critical for any expedition, and especially those venturing into remote areas where the trail network is more tenuous. You&#39;ll realise I&#39;m a great believer in technology - however I&#39;d like to point out from the outset that a paper map backup is always required.</description>

      <title>What is the Great Himalaya Trail?</title>
      <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/what-is-the-great-himalaya-trail/</link>

      <description>The Great Himalaya Trail is the combination of several trail networks stretching the length of the Himalaya range, with sections in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. Our trek will follow the High Route of the Nepal section from Kanchenjunga on the Indian border in the East to Hilsa on the Chinese border in the West.
The concept of the high route is that it follows the highest feasible continuous route across the country, averaging 3,750m (12,000ft) of elevation, with several passes taking us over 6,100m (20,000ft).</description>
