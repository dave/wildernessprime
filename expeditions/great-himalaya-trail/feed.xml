      <description>Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet found an app that has all the features I need for navigating a long trek like the Great Himalaya Trail, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be using these three apps in combination:
ViewRanger Advantages: Great maps. Ultimate flexibility - you can load lots of routes and adjust colours etc.
Disadvantages: Downloading maps takes hours. Impossible to select waypoints that are close to routes - e.g. most of them. (I think this bug is fixed in the Android version).</description>

      <title>Navigation - Emergencies</title>

      <description>I carry a Garmin Fenix 5 GPS watch, which I use just for emergency navigation. Emergency navigation is for when there&amp;rsquo;s zero visibility, no trail and adverse weather. The times when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be taking your phone out of your pocket every two minutes to check where you are.
I leave the watch turned off, but easily accessible in an outside pocket so I can get it when needed.</description>

      <title>Tracking</title>
      <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re planning to start the hike around April 12th 2019. Our Garmin InReach satellite tracker will update this map every few minutes. Our intended route is marked in red and yellow - each coloured section being one day of hiking, and our actual track is blue.

      <title>Navigation - Flashcards</title>

      <description>Robin&amp;rsquo;s guide book is excellent, but not organised optimally for a thru-hike of the GHT. I created a set of flashcards, one for each day of our itinerary. They are intended to be printed on A5, double sided. Included in each page is:
 The description from Robin&amp;rsquo;s guide book. Additional description from Himalaya Adventure Labs (marked with HAL). A crop from the Himalaya Map House 1:150k raster map. Stats from the GPX route including elevation range, min, max, total ascent and descent.</description>

      <title>Navigation - GPS routes</title>

      <description>ViewRanger will provide topo maps of the entire trekking area, but these would be of limited use without the route highlighted. The GHT is infrequently trekked, so there&amp;rsquo;s relatively few digital resources available. For the more popular ares, the ViewRanger topo maps often include footpaths - but for much of the trek there is nothing plotted on the map.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to bring all the available GPS resources together in this section:</description>

      <title>Navigation - Methods</title>

      <description>Navigating with the aid of digital topo maps is a game changer for unsupported trekking. However, extreme care must be taken because digital devices often fail in the field. We will be using several backups to mitigate this:
 My iPhone with topo mapping, offline maps and GPX route. Mathilde&amp;rsquo;s phone with similar setup. Backup iPod touch with similar setup. Garmin Fenix 5 GPS watch with waypoints and analogue compass (see emergency navigation article).</description>

      <title>Itinerary - Resupply</title>
      <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/</link>

      <description>Our general food strategy is to eat freshly cooked local food wherever possible, and not to reply on buying unprepared food along the trail that we cook later. Remote villages often will have nothing to sell apart from perhaps rice, flour and lentils - not exactly calorie dense or backpacking stove compatible. In order to ensure we have enough food between resupply points, I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to estimate where we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to eat local food.</description>

      <title>Itinerary - Summary</title>
      <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-summary/</link>

      <description>In any trek it&amp;rsquo;s important to get an idea of the approximate itinerary. Of course, on a long trek like this the exact route will need to be flexible, but I&amp;rsquo;ll plan the intended route and the maps and guide book will provide alternates when we need them. The alternates are almost certainly going to take us south and down hill where services and accommodation are more usually more plentiful.</description>

      <title>Navigation - Sources</title>

      <description>Navigation is critical for any expedition, and especially those venturing into remote areas where the trail network is more tenuous. You&amp;rsquo;ll realise I&amp;rsquo;m a great believer in technology - however I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out from the outset that a paper map backup is always required.
In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to go through some of the sources that are available for navigating the the 1300km Great Himalaya Trail. This posed my biggest navigation challenge to date.</description>

      <title>What is the Great Himalaya Trail?</title>
      <link>https://www.wildernessprime.com/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/what-is-the-great-himalaya-trail/</link>

      <description>The Great Himalaya Trail is the combination of several trail networks stretching the length of the Himalaya range, with sections in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. Our trek will follow the High Route of the Nepal section from Kanchenjunga on the Indian border in the East to Hilsa on the Chinese border in the West.
The concept of the high route is that it follows the highest feasible continuous route across the country, averaging 3,750m (12,000ft) of elevation, with several passes taking us over 6,100m (20,000ft).</description>
