      <title>Part 8: Trient and back to Champex</title>

      <description>The trail wound on, up into the hills once again for the last leg. To Trient, then down into the valley where we returned to the beautiful Lac Champex. This ends a magnificent 21 day hike from Zermatt to Chamonix and all the way round Mont Blanc. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen beautiful mountains all over the world, but nothing beats the European Alps for charm.</description>

      <title>Part 7: Les Houches, Chamonix</title>

      <description>We can see Les Houches and Chamonix in the distance for the long descent from the mountains. We had to make up a day so we bypassed the normal hiking trail along the Petit Balcon Sud, and walked through the centre of Chamonix. I&amp;rsquo;ve lived here for four winters but this was my first time visiting in the summer.</description>

      <title>Part 6: Refuge Des Mottets, Les Contamines</title>

      <description>The valley to the west of Courmayeur gets plusher and wetter the further we go. Lush green marsh land and cattle grazing.
We leave the bog behind and head up the mountain to the Col de la Seigne, and to the France border.
It&amp;rsquo;s a long and steep descent to the stoutly constructed Refuge de la Mottets. One of the more comfortable mountain huts we&amp;rsquo;ve visited.
The next day we&amp;rsquo;re hiking into easier terrain, and we soon reach the village of Les Contamines-Montjoie.</description>

      <title>Part 5: La Fouly, Courmayeur</title>

      <description>Onwards and upwards into the foothills of Mont Blanc from Lac Champex towards Italy. La Fouly is a cute little town with an amazing view, and I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend staying at the excellent Maya Joie hostel.
As we climbed further into the hills, the buildings became less frequent and the landscape more barren. The view down the valley towards Courmayeur from the Swiss Itallian border was one of the best of the trip.</description>

      <title>Part 4: Verbier, Champex</title>

      <description>Arguably the most beautiful town in the European Alps, Verbier overlooks the most picturesque valley. After the last few days of rocks, scrambling and mountains, this all seems rather civilised.
After a day hiking along the valley floor, again I&amp;rsquo;m ascending into the hills towards Lac Champex.
Again this doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint.</description>

      <title>Part 3: Dix, Prafleuri</title>

      <description>The next section led deep into the mountains. Up the valley to the ski resort of Arolla, and over the Pas de Chèvres to the imposing view of the Mont Blanc de Cheilon with La Cabane des Dix overlooking. I&amp;rsquo;ve visited the Dix hut several times on the winter version of this route, so I pushed on towards the Pas du Chat and the Lac Dix beyond.
Cabane de Prafleuri isn&amp;rsquo;t in the most picturesque setting - crouching in the barren quarry carved out of the landscape during the construction of the Dix dam.</description>

      <title>Part 2: Moiry</title>

      <description>The hike over the mountains to Gruben was a long way, but well worth the effort. The next day came a long traverse past the Lac de Moiry and up to the snout of the Moiry Glacier
The glacier was spectacular, and the cabin was the most amazing place, perched on the side of the mountain overlooking the river of ice.</description>

      <title>Part 1: Zermatt</title>

      <description>I hiked the Haute Route in the opposite direction to most people, starting in Zermatt under the majestic Matterhorn and heading down the valley towards Grächen along the Europaweg trail.
The Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the longest in the world, spanning almost 500m (1620ft). A recent landslide blocked the trail shortly after the bridge, forcing a re-route down into the valley to Randa.</description>
