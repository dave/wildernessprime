      <description>Navigation is critical for any expedition, and especially those venturing into remote areas where the trail network is more tenuous. You&amp;rsquo;ll realise I&amp;rsquo;m a great believer in technology - however I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out from the outset that a paper map backup is always required.
In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to go through some of the preparation I&amp;rsquo;m doing for navigating the 1700km GHT. This trail posed my biggest challenge to date.</description>

      <description>The Great Himalaya Trail is the combination of several trail networks stretching the length of the Himalaya range, with sections in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet. Our trek will follow the High Route of the Nepal section from Kanchenjunga on the Indian border in the East to Hilsa on the Chinese border in the West.
The idea behind the high route is that it follows the highest feasible continuous route across the country, averaging 3,750m (12,000ft) of elevation, with several passes taking us over 6,100m (20,000ft).</description>
