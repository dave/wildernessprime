I hiked the Haute Route in the opposite to most people, starting in Zermatt under the majestic Matterhorn and heading down the valley towards Gr√§chen along the Europaweg trail.

The Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the longest in the world, spanning almost 500m (1620ft).

A recent landslide blocked the trail shortly after the bridge, forcing a re-route down into the valley to Randa.
