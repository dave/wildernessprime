The tourist buses from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar weren’t running when I went, so I took the local bus. 
It takes between 6 and 10 hours depending on your luck. Mine took about 7, so I recommend taking the 
earliest bus possible and having lunch in Besi Sahar. The local bus costs 360 rupees ($3.60), and it 
left from Gongabu New Bus Station Park. When the bus arrives in Besi Sahar you’ll want to take it to 
the very last stop.

If you walk to the end of the main road in Besi Sahar, you’ll find the road goes downhill and to the 
right along the river. It seems there are several other routes, but for me, it was my first day 
carrying my own backpack. In the past, I’d always had a porter and carried a small day pack. Both 
David (my trekking buddy) and I agreed that it was unnecessary to make the first day harder than it 
had to be, so we decided to stick to the road instead of climbing a steep staircase on the trekking 
trail.

The road runs along the river and still offers lovely views. We started our trek in mid-May when 
most trekkers are already completing the circuit. Therefore, there weren’t many jeeps on the road. 
We were also trekking closer to monsoon season which means rainfall would be more likely, but there 
was also very little dust. The hike was only three hours up a gentle incline. We wanted to stay in 
Khudi, but the only guesthouse there was full when we arrived, so we moved on to Bhulbhule where we 
stayed in the Heaven Guest House.
