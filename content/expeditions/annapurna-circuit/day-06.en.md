After leaving Chame, we followed the main road for about an hour and a half. Along the way we stumbled upon an apple farm with a small tea shop and an extravagant hotel. It was the most beautiful lodging I’d seen in all of Nepal. The Farmhouse looked like it was straight out of Upstate New York, and reminded me so much of home. The small shop out front had incredible fresh chocolate covered donuts and apple tea. If you want to break up the trek with a bit of luxury, the hotel costs $60 a night for a room.

After tea we followed the road and took a path to the left which was a little bit steep, but not for long. It crossed through the main road and picked up immediately on the other side which had gorgeous pine tree forests. We decided to stop for an early lunch in Dhikur Pokhari at the Sworgadwari Rooftop Restaurant. It’s the first restaurant in town and has the best view of the steep sloping mountain range that you’ll see on the way.

After lunch we followed signs for Upper Pisang but somehow missed the trail on the right. We ended up in Lower Pisang after following the main road which is rather dusty. We continued on the road to Upper Pisang and headed for the tea houses at the top. The views from the top are incredible and Annapurna 2 looked gorgeous in the distance. We chose to stay at the Tuniche and Rooftop Restaurant where there’s a gas shower and large clean rooms. The entire city was without power (temporarily) so no one has electricity or WiFi. At the top of Upper Pisang is a beautiful monastery where you can stop by and listen to monks chanting before dinner.
