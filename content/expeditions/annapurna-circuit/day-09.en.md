To leave Manang, you’ll need to pass an ACAP check post to show your permits. After that, follow the main path and the signs pointing to Thorung La until you are out of the village. Once you leave, you’ll see the road split and the sign will point you to the right. The trail is easy to follow and looks more like a road. It has a gradual incline all the way to Gunsang where we stopped to have a cup of tea at the Chullu West Hotel on the left. From here you can see Ganggapurna. It took us about an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive here.

After Ganggapurna, it’s an easy and beautiful trek to Yak Kharka. We honestly could have continued onto the next town which is close by, but we fell in love with the teahouse we choose to have lunch at. The Ganggapurna Hotel has the cutest little dining area at the front and it has good WiFi, gas showers, and electricity (while the rest of the town’s power was out.) We got the room and WiFi for free in exchange for eating lots of food there. Hot showers were $2, but I heard they weren’t that great so I skipped one.
