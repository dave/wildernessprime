The first thing to do in any trek, it's important to get an idea of the approximate itinerary. Of course, on a long trek like this the exact route will need to be flexible, but I'll plan the intended route and the maps and guide book will provide alternates when we need them. The alternates are almost certainly going to take us south and down hill where services and accommodation are more usually more plentiful.

There are several companies that trek the Great Himalaya Trail fully supported... these operations take a handful of customers accompanied by an army of guides and porters. Some of them conveniently publish their daily itinerary, and this made a great start in my planning.

This route was easily cross referenced with Robin's guide book - obviously a large group always moves at the speed of the slowest member, so the fully supported itineraries moved quite a bit slower than we are hoping to. The guidebook gave us more realistic hiking times, along with various other sources I found online.
