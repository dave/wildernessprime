Robin's guide book is excellent, but not organised optimally for a thru-hike of the GHT. I created a set of flashcards, one for each day of our itinerary. They are intended to be printed on A5, double sided. Included in each page is:

* The description from Robin's guide book.
* Additional description from Himalaya Adventure Labs (marked with _HAL_).
* A crop from the Himalaya Map House 1:150k raster map.
* Stats from the GPX route including elevation range, min, max, total ascent and descent.
* An elevation profile graph for the day from GPSies.

Here's an example page:

I'm intending to use these paper flashcards as our primary navigation for the simple sections, only referring to the GPS topo maps when we need to.

I had a set of these flashcards printed on waterproof 115gsm Xerox NeverTear paper by [ColourGraphics](https://www.colourgraphics.com/). I couldn't be happier with the results - they're perfect:
