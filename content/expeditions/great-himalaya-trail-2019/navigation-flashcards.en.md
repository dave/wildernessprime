Robin's guide book is excellent, but not organised optimally for a thru-hike of the GHT. I created a set of flashcards, one for each day of our itinerary. They are intended to be printed on A5, double sided. Included in each page is:

* The description from Robin's guide book.
* Additional description from Himalaya Adventure Labs (marked with _HAL_).
* A crop from the Himalaya Map House 1:150k raster map.
* Stats from the GPX route including elevation range, min, max, total ascent and descent.
* An elevation profile graph for the day from GPSies.

I'm intending to use these paper flashcards as our primary navigation for the simple sections, only referring to the GPS topo maps when we need to. Here's an example page:

I would love to distribute the flashcards PDF, but since they contain most of the content from Robin's guide book, I can't really do that. Robin has the files and I've given him full permission to distribute them as he sees fit. He's a very nice chap - if you [buy the paper maps from his site](http://www.greathimalayatrail.com/ghtProductDetail.php?pid=MjM%3D) and ask him nicely I'm sure he'll send you a copy.

I had a set printed on waterproof 115gsm Xerox NeverTear paper by [ColourGraphics](https://www.colourgraphics.com/). I couldn't be happier with the results - they're perfect:
