The hike over the mountains to Gruben was a long way, but well worth the effort. The next day came a long traverse past the Lac de Moiry and up to the snout of the Moiry Glacier

The glacier was spectacular, and the cabin was the most amazing place, perched on the side of the mountain overlooking the river of ice.
