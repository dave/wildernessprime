On the 30th December 2019 I'll be sailing from the southern tip of Argentina to the Antarctic peninsula for a 
month long expedition. After three days crossing the infamous Drake Passage we'll be heading inland on skis, 
dragging sleds across the glaciers, to set up base-camp. We'll spend a couple of weeks camped on the ice and 
plan to summit some previously unclimbed peaks.
