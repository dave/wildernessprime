Navigating with the aid of digital topo maps is a game changer for unsupported trekking. However, extreme care must be taken because digital devices often fail in the field. We will be using several backups to mitigate this:

* My iPhone with topo mapping, offline maps and GPX route.
* Mathilde's phone with similar setup.
* Backup iPod touch with similar setup.
* Garmin Fenix 5 GPS watch with waypoints and analogue compass (see Emergency Navigation article).
* Backup 13,000mAh battery with 21W solar panel.
* Daily flashcards for the intended route with map snapshots, descriptions and elevation profile (see [Flashcards](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail-2019/navigation-flashcards/) article).
* Himalaya Map House paper maps - 1:150k covering a wide area with alternate routes.

We'll use the paper flashcards to get an overview of the day, and as primary navigation on simple days. As the route gets more tricky we'll fall back on our phones, running the ViewRanger topo mapping app with offline mapping for the entire trekking region. I have an old iPod touch which has also been configured with this app for another backup. For emergency navigation in bad conditions we'll use my Garmin Fenix GPS watch with an analogue compass. See the Emergency Navigation article on how this is used. Finally as a paper backup we'll be carrying the Himalaya Map House paper maps which cover the entire trekking region with many other alternate trails marked.

We have spent considerable time planning the ideal route along the GHT High Route. This will undoubtably change as the trek progresses... However the alternate trails will lead south towards lower elevations which usually have more population and services... so the navigation should get easier as we deviate from the High Route.

> It should be noted that ViewRanger is not particularly efficient at downloading offline maps, so getting the entire GHT route map area was a major task. The maximum area that can be downloaded in one go it quite small, so I needed sixteen chunks to get the whole route. Each chunk took several hours, and the operation would pause if the app was not running in the foreground. I found the only reliable way to get it done without quarantining my phone was to start each chunk downloading before I went to bed and leave the phone on charge, turned on with the app running in the foreground. This way the process took almost two weeks. I repeated the entire process with my backup iPod touch.
