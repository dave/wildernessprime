We'll be using a Garmin InReach Mini for communicating with the outside world during the trek. It uses the Iridium satellite network to allow two-way short message communication anywhere in the world, even when far away from a mobile network. It has several useful features:

## Messaging

The device can send and receive short, 140 character messages. Messages are sent from the outside world using a simple web form - feel free to [send us a message](...). Outgoing messages are usually created on a phone with bluetooth connection, but in an emergency can be composed on the device.

## Social updates

The device can send messages to a preset Twitter / Facebook feed. Unfortunately the Facebook integration needs to be refreshed every 90 days so won't work for our trek, but Twitter seems to work fine.

## Live tracking

The device can update a live [tracking map](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/) with an automatic track point every few minutes, manual waypoints or short messages.

## Emergency SOS

In an emergency, an SOS button automaticlly alerts a central emergency control center that can contact search and rescue services.

## Weather reports

A weather report can be requested. The response shows a pretty basic weather report for the next few days. The reports unfortunately show temperature at a mystery elevation instead of the freezing level so they're of limited use in the mountains.
