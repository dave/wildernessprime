#### Post trail update

This page is out of date. We didn't use the 3D models on the trek.

[Maps3d.io](https://maps3d.io/) is an amazing service that easily converts a GPX route into a GLTF format 3D model, using satellite imagery and elevation data. These can be displayed on the web (as below) or in a mobile app. 

I've downloaded models for all 115 days to my phone, so while we're on the trek we should be able to preview the next section in glorious 3D. It makes visualising the route so much easier than looking at a topo map. I've been using the [glTFShowcase](https://www.vispolygon.com/) app to view the models on my phone. You can find a [Dropbox folder here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cjp3cn26qqxgx6g/AAAyDiNInCspvUKdjmAKPodna?dl=0) containing all the models if you want to do the same.

Select a day from the itinerary and the model will load below:
