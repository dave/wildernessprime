## Vlog

I filmed a short vlog style video every day of the trek. You can find weekly summaries here:

Mustang, Dolpa, Rara Lake and Humla

* [Week 1: Kanchenjunga](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-01) I'm hiking up the Kanchenjunga Base Camp trail towards the far north east corner of Nepal.  
* [Week 2: Kanchenjunga](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-02) I reached the amazing Kanchenjunga Base Camp, and started the first really remote section.  
* [Week 3: Makalu](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-03) The shit is really starting to hit the fan as I cross the first high pass.    
* [Week 4: Makalu](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-04) I get a helicopter rescue and finally meet my hiking buddy Mathilde.  
* [Week 5: Everest](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-05) We cross the highest, most technical and most dangerous passes of the whole trek.  
* [Week 6: Everest](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-06) We hike through the most spectacular scenery as we take a detour to Cho Oyu Base Camp.  
* [Week 7: Rolwaling](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-07) More amazing scenery as we tackle yet another major pass.  
* [Week 8: Rolwaling](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-08) We leave the high mountains and get our first taste of how hot and humid Nepal can be at the lower elevations.  
* [Week 9: Helambu](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-09) A week of slogging through heat, humidity and leeches into the high mountains again.  
* [Week 10: Langtang](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-10) Another huge pass with full mountaineering gear, and we take a very refreshing swim on the way down.  
* [Week 11: Ganesh Himal](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-11) Finally monsoon hits, we both get sick and make some huge navigational blunders. A hard week!  
* [Week 12: Manaslu](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-12) Some more pleasant trekking and spectacular views as we join the Manaslu Circuit trail.  
* [Week 13: Annapurna](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-13) Into the Annapurna region now, so easy hiking through beautiful scenery, but a big change of plans at the end.  
* [Week 14: Mustang](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-14) We take an unconventional exit from Annapurna, and enter the utterly spectacular Dolpa region.  
* [Week 15: Dolpa](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-15) The scenery gets better and better as we trek through Dolpa, but will we make it out of the mountains in one piece? Major navigation and tent disasters this week.  
* [Week 16: Dolpa](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-16) Long, hot, exhausting days across rugged terrain as we continue through Dolpa... and we're lucky to be alive after some terrible decisions.  
* [Week 17: Rara](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-17) Baking in the sun, sinking in the mud, and we cross the final 5,000m pass of the trek.  
* [Week 18: Humla](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/week-18) An emotional end to the trek as we arrive at the Chinese border.
