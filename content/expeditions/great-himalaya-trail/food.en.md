We will eat as much freshly prepared food as we can. Dal Bhat is delicious and we want to support the local economy as much as possible. However, we'll only have access to locally prepared food on about half the 115 days in the itinerary. The rest of the food we'll have to take with us. We would love to be able to resupply at shops along the route, but the remote villages rarely sell backpacking compatible food. It's not really possible to cook lentils and rice on a backpacking stove.

Our logistics partner [Mactrek](http://www.mactreks.com/) will be arranging several supply packages to be delivered to us at [various points](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/) along the route, but we'll have to carry ten days of food at several points. Calorie density is essential, and ease of preparation is also important.

## Breakfast

We will be having a fast-and-light breakfast of an [RxBar](https://www.rxbar.com/), 100g of trail mix and a hot coffee.

## Lunch

Lunch will be easy to prepare - no stove needed - 100g of [Huel](https://huel.com/) protein shake, a [ProBar Meal](http://shop.theprobar.com/Products/PROBAR-Meal) energy bar, and half an [FBOMB](https://www.dropanfbomb.com/collections/nut-butters) nut butter sachet.

## Dinner

Dinner will be an [Expeditions Foods](https://expeditionfoods.com/) 1000 calorie dehydrated backpacking meal, and a hot chocolate drink. We'll add half an [FBOMB](https://www.dropanfbomb.com/collections/fbomb-oils) oil sachet as a calorie boost. This should give us 2,912 calories per day for 612g.

## Energy bars

Thanks very much to [RxBar](https://www.rxbar.com/) for sending us a selection of their [RxBar energy bars](https://www.rxbar.com/shop.html/).
