## Leg 8: Khangpachen to Lhonak

Trail was usually easy to follow with a few tricky areas. I made a mistake and ended up higher up the bank of the river traversing across a very dangerous landslide area. In the end I managed to descend safely to the river bed but then spent an hour scrambling over large boulders before I found the trail again.

## Leg 9: Lhonak to Pangpema

Trail was tricky to follow with a couple of large new landslides which meant lengthy diversions to find safe places to cross, and scrambling.

#### Waypoints <span class="print-only">(leg 9)</span>



<div class="no-page-break">

**L009 Landslide (5,060 m / 16,600 ft)**: This huge landslide had recently blocked the path (as of spring 2019). A lengthy detour was needed to find a safe place to cross. The route has been updated to show my detour.

</div>



</div>





<div class="no-page-break">

**L009 Pangpema (5,140 m / 16,900 ft)**: There was a small shack at Pangpema (aka Kanchenjunga Base Camp) which I could have stayed at, but I chose to camp. I believe the staff come from Lhonak as and when they are needed, so best to ask them if you plan to stay overnight here without camping.

## Leg 14: Kharka to Yangjong Kharka

Trail was almost non existent and obscured with snow for much of the day. However above the tree line the terrain was open so the route was easy to follow without a trail on the ground.

**L014 Yangjong Kharka (3,740 m / 12,300 ft)**: On the descent down from Nango La you will find a basic shelter at Yangjong Kharka. You should stay here overnight because after the shelter the trail deviates significantly from the description in the guidebook and paper maps. The guidebook and paper maps have you camping at the Yangma Khola bridge but I found no trail on the ground going this way, and I didn't see any more good camping options until Olangchun Gola. The shelter is almost brand new and very clean (as of spring 2019).

## Leg 22: Molun Pokhari to Clearing Camp

The guidebook explains how to find a bridge over the Kholakharka Khola, but despite hours of searching I didn't manage to find it. I eventually stayed overnight in the shelter at the source of the river. The next day I tried to follow the Kholakharka Khola back downstream on the east bank, but found no trail and dense undergrowth. I gave up and called a helicopter. I later talked to one trekker who also attempted this section. He got further by scrambling over rocks in the river gully, only to find the pass impossible the next day - he too ended up calling a helicopter. I made contact with another trekker (Suvi) who successfully completed this section, and I've integrated their InReach track into the route. Suvi was tracking using an InReach which drops a GPS location only once every ten minutes, so the route from here until Yangla Kharka is rather rough. Suvi reported that the trail is extremely tricky to follow with sections of bushwhacking. If you successfully complete this section, please record an accurate GPS log and I'll improve the route (dave@brophy.uk).

**L028 Sherpani Col (6,160 m / 20,200 ft)**: Crossing Sherpani Col involves a 100m climb, then a 100m down climb on the other side. We were able to clip into a fixed safety wire for the climb and descent, but a fall would still be extremely dangerous. At the bottom of the down-climb there was a small bergschrund before we reached the crevassed glacial plateau that separates Sherpani Col and West Col.

<div class="no-page-break">

**L028 Advanced Base Camp (6,110 m / 20,000 ft)**: Although the itinerary proposes an overnight stay here at Advanced Base Camp I would highly recommend not camping here. Most groups continue over West Col and complete legs 28 and 29 in one long day, as we did. The plateau is at 6000m and extremely exposed, so camping here should only be attempted in an emergency.

Amphu Labsta is one of the most dangerous passes in Nepal, and the route climbs technical terrain to reach the pass. The safest route may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.

Our route differs significantly from that marked on digital maps, but I'm sure the safest route is different every year. Parts of the ascent we were able to clip into a safety wire, but there were parts where it was hidden under impenetrable ice. After the pass a 30m rappel is needed.

If conditions aren't perfect, I would recommend considering staying overnight at the shelter. If you do this, be sure to leave early the next day because it adds 1.2km and a 330m climb to the day.

## Leg 43: Tashi Labsta Camp to Glacier Camp

The route is on crevassed, glaciated terrain for most of the day. Although not as technical as Amphu Labsta, the same warnings apply. The safest route across Tashi Labsta may change year-to-year so an experienced mountaineer in the group is absolutely essential. Full mountaineering gear is required for this leg.

<div class="no-page-break">

**L043 Tashi Labsta (5,770 m / 18,900 ft)**: The approach to Tashi Labsta is up a huge steep pile of glacial moraine with constant danger of rocks slipping. We then climbed a very steep snow bank, which required ropes and crampons. The final section across the glacier and up to the pass was under cliffs with constant danger of rock fall from above. The first half of the descent down from the pass was extremely difficult, following the glacier with many crevasses to cross. The final part of the descent was even worse where we had to climb down a stream gully with water splashing all over us.

**L043 Glacier Camp (4,880 m / 16,000 ft)**: We stayed overnight at this very rocky area on the glacier. I suspect that a better site could be found given more time but the sun was going down so we took the first opportunity to pitch the tent.

## Leg 44: Glacier Camp to Na

The first half of this leg follows the glacier, a huge boulder field. An altogether unpleasant experience. There is a trail along the top of the lateral moraine on the left side, and I believe it starts earlier than we picked it up, so I would recommend trying to climb the moraine before our route does. The second half of the day was an easy to follow trail down the Na.

## Leg 53: Tinsang Kewa to Sano Jyandan

The first part of this leg was a very dangerous traverse across a steep hillside above cliffs with very little in the way of a path - a slip here could have been deadly. We then had to negotiate a section of dense rhododendron bushes with many dead-ends and backtracking. Hundreds of leeches were a major annoyance. After that we found a dirt road, but a major navigational blunder meant we missed the correct trail Sano Jyandan. We didn't stay at Sano Jyandan, so the rating is for the guesthouse we stayed at in Madre. However, I have left the route going via Sano Jyandan and I would recommend you try to follow it. If anyone has successfully completed this section, please get in touch (dave@brophy.uk) because I'd love to integrate your GPS tracks into this route. Note that in the vlog I incorrectly state that we passed Sano Jyandan, in fact our track turns off well before this.

**L053 Warning (3,040 m / 9,980 ft)**: We made a huge navigational blunder here. The dirt road follows a switchback to the left, and we assumed it followed the route towards Sano Jyandan. We were wrong and it continued in completely the wrong direction down into the basin to the south. The correct route traverses along the ridge to Sano Jyandan before descending towards the north. As we descended we slowly realised that the road would not be rejoining the correct route, but by the time we fully understood this we had lost significant elevation, and the climb back up to the ridge seemed too far. We continued descending, hoping that the road would eventually lead us west and follow the hillside around towards the north. We realise the road we were on didn't go that way, but a road below us did head that way, so we bushwhacked down to the lower road. This ended up being a major detour and we ended up staying at a homestay at Madre. I have left the route going to Sano Jyandan, but it should be noted that we didn't hike it past this waypoint. The route in the GPX file after this point is just copied from the paper maps, so should not be relied upon.

## Leg 60: Tin Pokhari to High South Camp

The trail follows the glacier up to Tillmans Pass, and involves scrambling over glacial boulder fields for most of the day. I believe we made a mistake by following the lateral moraine on the west side of the glacier. A better option would be to get on the east side. This would mean less scrambling since you don't have to cross a second glacier that joins from the west.

The route crosses crevassed, glaciated terrain. Although not as technical as Tashi Labsta or Amphu Labsta, care is needed. The safest route across Tilman's Pass may change year-to-year so some mountaineering experience is recommended. Full mountaineering gear is recommended for this leg.

## Leg 62: High North Camp to Kyangjin Gompa

We had major problems here. The route before the Langtang Khola crossing is very wild - no trail on the ground and often bushwhacking through dense shrubland. Moving through this terrain is slow and frustrating. We descended the Langshisha Khola from High North Camp on the west moraine towards Langshisha Kharka. This was a bad decision because the only bridge over the Langtang Khola was on the east side of the Langshisha Khola. We spent most of the day bushwhacking back up the Langshisha Khola through dense shrubland to find a safe place to cross, only to give up and return to Langshisha Kharka to camp overnight. We continued searching early the next morning, hoping the water would be lower. It was noticeably lower but still too dangerous to cross. Our party split up, and the two others managed to cross the Langshisha Khola nearer the glacier. Mathi and I eventually made a very dangerous crossing of the Langtang Khola assisted by a rope. We were swept away by the fast flowing river and dragged to safety by the others on the opposite side. This was a really bad idea and not recommended in the slightest. I have updated the route to immediately descend from High North Camp and cross the Langshisha Khola as soon as possible. Be very careful descending from High North Camp towards the Langshisha Khola - in October 2021 Eyal experienced very difficult terrain and dangerous avalanche conditions here and had a bad fall. Take your time and be prepared to backtrack to find a safer route. Once you're across the Langshisha Khola, the route continues down on the east side to the bridge. Be aware that this was the situation in spring 2019, and the bridge may have been changed (update in October 2021: the bridge is still there). Also with less water in the river this could have been a completely different experience. After you cross the Langtang Khola to the north bank you pick up the Langtang trail which is well maintained and easy to follow.

## Leg 86: Ghalden Ghuldun to Nulungsumda Kharka

Very tricky to follow trail, which was steep with slippery crumbling slate fragments underfoot in places. We made a navigational blunder by following what looked like a horse track on the ground. This led in the wrong direction and we then chose a dangerous exposed traverse instead of backtracking (the route does not take this detour).

If you stay overnight here, take note of the options for crossing the river in the morning. When we crossed there was a partially broken bridge, and although the river was shallow, we had to get wet feet. An early morning start at over 5,000m meant that it was well below freezing, and getting wet was very uncomfortable.

## Leg 87: Nulungsumda Kharka to Chharka Bhot

We had a huge problem here. The trail on the east side of the Thansan Khola was blocked. We backtracked and camped overnight at Norbulung. In the morning we made a very bad decision. I believe the best way would have been to continue towards Chharka Bhot on the west bank after crossing the Thansan Khola. I would recommend doing this, and have left the route going this way to Chharka Bhot even though we didn't go this way. We made the decision to hike up the Yalku Khola, heading towards one of the passes near Chharka Bhot. The upper parts of the Yalku Khola were not passable, and the pass we were aiming for didn't look safe at all. We changed plans several times, and ended up hiking for two days over mountainous terrain with no trails on the map or the ground. The route we took skipped Chharka Bhot entirely and continued directly west across the mountains to the Chap Chu East waypoint, camping overnight at Sipalun Kharka. This part of the route was relatively easy with no particularly dangerous terrain. However, the problem is that you arrive at Chap Chu on the east side of the Bharbun Khola. There is no bridge and when we were there (August 16th) the river was far too swollen to cross. After taking advice from some Yak herders, we followed a rough trail south to Sinjik expecting the water to be lower, however this was incorrect and in fact the water was higher. Sinjik was deserted with a few derelict buildings, and as far as we could see the path finished there and we couldn't go any further south. We were out of options and about to give up when a local man appeared and led us along the most perilous trails I've ever hiked in my life. Slippery rocks with certain death falls inches away. I would highly recommend not trying to repeat this route! After a couple of hours we arrived in Thinmer where we stayed overnight in a basic homestay. Thinmer has a bridge over the Bharbun Khola, and the trail north to Chap Chu on the west side of the river was safe and well maintained. If you would like our detailed GPS tracks for this route, you can find them in our raw GPX logs (days 123-126), however be warned that the section from Sinjik to Thinmer was exceedingly dangerous and I would absolutely not repeat it myself.

**L087 Cross (4,760 m / 15,600 ft)**: The Thansan Khola is shallow at this point and we easily crossed (August 15th).

## Leg 88: Chharka Bhot to Chap Chu

Extreme care should be taken if hiking this route from Chharka Bhot to Chap Chu. We did not hike this way, and the route is just copied from the paper maps. There is no trail shown on digital maps, which usually indicates the trail on the ground is tenuous or non-existent. The guidebook mentions there are several crossings of the Bharbun Khola required with no bridge. We only saw that river south (downstream) of Chap Chu, but I would expect crossing it would have been impossible even further upstream when we were there (August 16th). The guidebook and paper maps mention an alternative trail that takes a more remote northerly route from Chharka Bhot to Dho Tarap via Mola La (5030m) and Jhyarkoi La (5360m). I suggest you talk to locals at Chharka Bhot and work out the best option considering the current conditions. It may be possible to arrange a local guide - I would highly recommend that. Again I must stress that I believe this leg would have been impossible when we were here (August 16th) due to the river being too swollen. If you find a reliable, safe route through this section, please contact me (dave@brophy.uk) because I would love to use your GPS tracks and trail notes here.

## Leg 89: Chap Chu to Dho Tarap

The first half of this leg was extremely tricky, and required long sections of bushwhacking through dense shrubland. There were several crossings of a river, which was small enough that we managed to avoid getting our feet wet by hopping across rocks. As soon as we climbed above the treeline the terrain become easier to traverse and a trail on the ground became apparent. The ascent to the pass and the descent into Dho Tarap were much easier to navigate. There are several small rivers crossings with no bridges, but none were more than ankle deep (August 19th).

There was no trail marked on the ground, and we had to backtrack several times to find safer places to cross the river.

## Leg 97: Pho to Pung Kharka

I believe we made a navigational error when departing Pho. We headed approximately north towards the rightmost of two chortens that were visible in the distance from the village. After passing the chorten, the trail stopped and we spent the three hours bushwhacking across steep shrubland to the ridge. If I was to hike this leg again I'd try aiming for the leftmost chorten and hope that the trail continues all the way to the ridge. When we reached the ridge, we found a trail that seemed to come from the south from the general direction of Pho, so I believe this was an easier route. However the terrain was relatively open so the section of bushwhacking didn't post any significant dangers. I have left the route following our track. If you find a better route through this section, please contact me (dave@brophy.uk) because I would love to use your GPS track. Once we reached the ridge, we found a trail that was relatively easy to follow. Take note of the waypoint that marks the descent from the ridge because it may be easy to miss.

## Leg 99: Chyandi Khola to Takla Khola

We made a string of bad decisions today that resulted in the most dangerous situation of the trek. We missed a trail and continued hiking down the Chyandi Khola directly next to the river. As we continued the banks became increasingly steep and we had to pass increasingly dangerous obstacles to continue following the river. As the number of perilous situations we encountered grew, the prospect of backtracking through them again seemed more and more problematic. In the end, it was impossible to continue, and we made the decision to climb out of the river gorge up a steep bank. This was utterly idiotic and could have easily cost us our lives. We had no idea what was above us, and the terrain was so steep that we were basically rock climbing with no safety equipment. When we reached the top of the ridge, we found a well trodden trail that led down to a bridge over the Kaitpuchonam Khola. Neither of us were in any mood for more adventures, so we camped as soon as we crossed the bridge. I have adjusted the route to follow where I'm guessing the trail comes from, but be aware that we completely missed it, so this is very approximate. We completed the rest of this leg to Takla Khola the next day, which was tricky to follow and very steep in places.

## Leg 109: Apsia Lek to Punkha Khola

Take care to follow the route carefully when leaving Apsia Lek. The correct trail traverses the hillside without descending. We took two wrong trails and had to backtrack twice. Apart from this difficulty, the trail was well maintained and easy to follow.

**L110 River Camp (2,990 m / 9,800 ft)**: We stayed overnight at a very cramped camp site at River Camp. The only flat ground had dense green leafy plants growing all over it, so we ended up pitching the tent on top of 20cm of foliage. It wasn't actually too bad after carefully clearing it of all the sharp sticks hiding underneath.
