I had initially intended to use my Zpacks 20F (-7C) sleeping bags, augmented with down jacket and pants. However, after working out the overnight temperatures we'll be facing (as low as -20C) I changed my mind and we'll be taking my Feathered Friends Snowbunting 0F (-17C) sleeping bags. They're not particularly lightweight at around 1.3kg, and don't pack down very small. We'll take both models to Nepal and possible swap to the lighter ones for the warmer sections. I may still take my lighter sleeping bag for the first section where I'm hiking solo.

For a sleeping pad we'll be taking the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xtherm - the standard winter inflatable sleeping pad. We'll also take a thin Evazote foam pad cut to the size of the inflatable pad. This will give protection from sharp objects, stop the inflatable pad from sliding on the DCF floor, and also work well as a camp seat.

We'll have the Trekology Ultralight Pillow - they seem to be pretty comfortable and were much cheaper than the alternatives.
