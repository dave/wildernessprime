We won't have good internet for most of the trek, so we're not expecting to update the blog while we're away. However, our [satellite communicator](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/communication/) will allow us to tweet from the trail. If you're a twitter user you can follow [@wildernessprime](https://twitter.com/wildernessprime). If not, our feed is below. 

I will arrive in Kathmandu on the 6th April 2019 and plan to start trekking on the 14th. Expect regular twitter updates from then. You can also check out our [live tracking page](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tracking/) where you'll find a map with our current location.
