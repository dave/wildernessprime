In the summer of 2019 we spent five months hiking the Great Himalaya Trail across Nepal. Every day I made a vlog video of the trek. I've finally got them ready to show the world. Here's the trailer - the vlog episodes start on Saturday. Feel free to subscribe / share. This has been a huge project over the past few months and I'm super happy with the result!
