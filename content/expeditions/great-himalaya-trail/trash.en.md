As our backpacking food arrived I've been getting more and more concerned about the amount of plastic trash we'll be generating. The remote regions of Nepal have very limited rubbish disposal facilities, and plastic trash is often dumped. I was constantly depressed by the trash littering the trails when I hiked the Annapurna Circuit last year. So I'm going to make a pledge.

## Our pledge

We won't leave any plastic trash in Nepal. We will leave the country with all the plastic we arrived with. Our resupply packages will be delivered by a porter who will return to Kathmandu with all our trash. We will store it in Kathmandu, and at the end of the trek I will return to the UK with the whole lot and send it to be recycled.
