#### Post trail update

You can read more about the mountaineering sections on the [Trail Notes page](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/trail-notes/). 
Also check out the FAQ: [What are the most difficult / technical parts?](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/faq/#what-are-the-most-difficult--technical-parts).

The route has five passes that require moderate mountaineering skills and equipment. You can read more about the gear we'll be using on these sections on the [Gear - Mountaineering](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/gear-mountaineering/) page.

We'll be enlisting the services of a mountaineering guide to assist us over these five sections - [Sherpani Col](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/sherpani-col/), [West Col](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/west-col/), [Amphu Labsta La](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/amphu-labsta-la/), [Tashi Labsta La](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tashi-labsta-la/) and [Tilman's Pass](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/tilmans-pass/). 

Our mountaineering guide, Zangmu Sherpa is from the Everest Makalu area has provided assistance in 8000m+ mountain climbs. He has crossed Sherpani Col, West Col, Amphu Labsta, and Tashi Labsta five times times, so should be an excellent guide.
