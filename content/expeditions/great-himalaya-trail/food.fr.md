We will eat as much freshly prepared food as we can. Dal Bhat is delicious and we want to support the local economy as much as possible. However, we'll only have access to locally prepared food on about half the 115 days in the itinerary. The rest of the food we'll have to take with us. We would love to be able to resupply at shops along the route, but the remote villages rarely sell backpacking compatible food. It's not really possible to cook lentils and rice on a backpacking stove.

Our logistic partner [Mactrek](http://www.mactreks.com/) will be arranging several supply packages to be delivered to us at [various points](/expeditions/great-himalaya-trail/itinerary-resupply/) along the route, but we'll have to carry ten days of food at several points. Calorie density is essential, and ease of preparation is also important.

We will be having a fast-and-light breakfast of an energy bar, 100g of trail mix and a hot coffee. Lunch will be easy to prepare - no stove needed - 100g of protein shake and an energy bar. Dinner will be a high calorie dehydrated backpacking meal with hot water, and a hot chocolate drink. We'll carry a bottle of olive oil which we'll add to dinner as a calorie boost. This should give us 2,673 calories for 560g.

## Energy bars

Thanks very much to [RxBar](https://www.rxbar.com/) sponsoring our expedition by sending us a [selection of their RxBars](https://www.rxbar.com/shop/rxbar.html/).
